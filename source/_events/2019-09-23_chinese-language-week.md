Zao shang hao, everyone. 

Thanks for participating in the daily quiz. 

Yesterday winners are: Celtic White, Georgia Hiscotte, Kevin Chen, Louise and Robyn from Student Centre. Well done. 

As Confucius says: Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall. 

Today’s question is: What is this country 新西兰？Clue: you can use either dictionary or draw it on Google translate. 

Good luck :-)
