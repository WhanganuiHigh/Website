As Confucius says: When it is obvious that the goals cannot be reached, don't adjust the goals, adjust the action steps. 

Yesterday winners: Jemma Tan, Angus Pitkethley, Odette Tofa and Akinyele Godfavour. Congratulations. 

Todayâ€™s quiz: A 'fenghuang' is the name of a Chinese mythical creature, usually translated as what? The answer is not dragon. 

By the way, there is a Chinese Karaoke at 1st break today in L3. Turn up if you enjoy singing or Chinese music. 

Have a good day.
