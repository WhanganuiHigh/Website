Ni hao, this week is the Chinese language week. 

Confucius says: I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand. Therefore, try some Chinese language. It is FUN :-) There is a daily quiz this week and chocolate prize for winners. 

Today's question: how to say WHS is awesome in Chinese? You can Email your answer to Mr Ding ding.b@whs.ac.nz or write it on a note then give to student centre. 

Have fun.

Teacher of Chinese_
