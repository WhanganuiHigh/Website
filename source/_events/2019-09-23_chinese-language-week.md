Dear students, as Confucius says: 

Learn avidly. Question it repeatedly. Analyse it carefully. Then put what you have learned into practice intelligently. 

Hopefully you enjoy the Chinese language week, there is a GONG FU master at one of the gyms today 1st break. If you would like to try, turn up. 

Enjoy your holidays and keep up Chinese
