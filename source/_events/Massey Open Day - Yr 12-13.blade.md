<p><span>Massey and UCOL Palmerston North are having an Open Day on Wednesday 7 August. </span></p>


Thank you to those who signed up. Printed & Named permission slips are now in form class registers, as well as copies e-mailed to students and parents. Please have parents use the on-line form to respond, rather than hard copy. The cost is $17, paid by 31st July. 

If you **forgot to sign up** but still wish to go, get a generic permission slip from the student centre and return with payment **by 31 July**. Remember to register at Massey.ac.nz
