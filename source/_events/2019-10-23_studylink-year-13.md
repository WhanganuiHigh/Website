Staff from MSD will visit school this Thursday to run an on-line studylink application session. 

LAST CHANCE to register for this TODAY (23/10/19) at bit.ly/whsstudylink2019. You also need a RealMe account. Do this at Realme.govt.nz. (if you don't already have one). 

You must apply to Studylink by 16 December to be sure of money for 2020.
