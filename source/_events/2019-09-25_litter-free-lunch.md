Whanganui High School Student Council have put together the schools very first Litter Free Lunch Day, to be held on the last Friday of this term. 

In an effort to reduce the rubbish around the school and improve environmental sustainability, students have been taught in assemblies some more environmentally friendly alternatives to plastic, and have been asked to come to school with a litter-free lunchbox. 

Those who do will be rewarded with a free sausage sizzle, partially sponsored by Pak'N'Save Whanganui. Alternatively, if a student doesn't have a rubbish free lunch, they can collect rubbish from around the school and recycle it in the mobile recycling trailer that will be brought in from WRRC, and claim their free sausage too.

Whanganui High School, as well as many other schools around Whanganui will be taking part in this litter-free challenge on 27 September that has been established by the Whanganui Resource Recovery Centre.
