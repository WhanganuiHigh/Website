Remember to bring your lunch "litter free" on Friday 27 September! 

Form teachers will be giving out tickets during form time on Friday morning to those who have litter free lunch. 

Bring your tickets to the BBQ trailer at the back of the gyms at first break to claim your free sausage.

No litter free lunch? No worries! Come and grab a rubbish bag from the BBQ area and collect some rubbish from around the school, bring it back to the recycling trailer and claim your free sausage!

Whanganui High School Student Council have put together the schools very first Litter Free Lunch Day, to be held on the last Friday of this term. 

In an effort to reduce the rubbish around the school and improve environmental sustainability, students have been taught in assemblies some more environmentally friendly alternatives to plastic, and have been asked to come to school with a litter-free lunchbox. 

Those who do will be rewarded with a free sausage sizzle, partially sponsored by Pak'N'Save Whanganui. Alternatively, if a student doesn't have a rubbish free lunch, they can collect rubbish from around the school and recycle it in the mobile recycling trailer that will be brought in from WRRC, and claim their free sausage too.

Whanganui High School, as well as many other schools around Whanganui will be taking part in this litter-free challenge on 27 September that has been established by the Whanganui Resource Recovery Centre.
