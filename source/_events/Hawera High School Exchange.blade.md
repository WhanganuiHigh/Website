#### Due to a fatal accident on the Waitotara river bridge this morning the Hawera High Sports Exchange has been cancelled.

#### This meant that the three busloads of students returned back to school where they stayed in the Te Ihi gym until the bell went for first break.  All students will then go to their normal classes from period 3 onwards.  


Teams going:

Senior A Girls & Boys Basketball team  
1st XI Boys & Girls Football  
1st XV Rugby, U15 Rugby

The teams will be travelling in buses on the day. Students are to be in school uniform at the school **Bus Bay at 8am** to check in, aiming to leave at 8:15am on the dot and expecting to be home around 4pm back at the school Bus Bay.  

Students bring lunch, drink bottles, playing gear, shoes, mouth guards.
