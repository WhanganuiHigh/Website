The Feilding High School Teen Ag club would like to invite our club to their 2019 Inter-school Agri Sports day on Friday 16 August 2019. 

We will be running modules for both Juniors (Year 9 and 10) and Seniors (Year 11-13).
Modules will be both practical and theory based. 

Cost - $5 per student ($20 per team)

Lunch will be supplied to competitors and staff on the day. Please get students to bring their own drink bottles. 

Students need to be in ‘farm appropriate’ gear.

Expressions of interest to Mr Costelloe by Tuesday 6 August.
