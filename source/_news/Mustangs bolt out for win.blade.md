<p class="element element-paragraph">After some mixed results last weekend both Castlecliff Club Mustangs teams came out all guns blazing posting solid victories in the Manawatu Senior Men's Reserve Grade sofyball league on Saturday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Castlecliff Club Mustangs made amends for their first round loss to Raiders, convincingly beating them 12-3, while Mustangs Black remain unbeaten this round with a 14-10 win over Linton Bombers.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Raiders were dismissed at their first turn at bat without scoring.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Lead off batter for the Mustangs, <strong>Josh Hollis</strong>, hit safely to reach second base, next batter Jefferson Yacap hit a single to reach base, <strong>Trent Hemi</strong> then hit to right feild to score both Hollis and Yacap. With Hemi on second base <strong>Jake Hollis</strong> hit safely to bring him home while Petera Rurawhe Martin then hit to score Hollis.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The scoring stopped there as the next batters were taken out.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In the second innings Aaron Mahoney put down the perfect bunt to reach base then stole second while Yacap hit safely. <strong>Hemi</strong> belted the the ball deep to score himself and the base runners.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ruarwhe Martin got himself on base when he hit safely, and was scored from a hit by Regan Calder that put the Mustangs ahead 8-0. Raiders managed to score two runs when Shaun Terry smashed a three base hit to score them both.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mustangs made some changes allowing lead batter Devon Maihi and Calder to hit big for a home run apiece. Rurawhe was next to score when batted in by Cameron Hollis.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mustangs last run was scored by Mahoney after he hit safely and was batted in by Hemi.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Pitching for the Mustangs,&nbsp;<strong>Hemi</strong> recorded nine strikeouts.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Very nice to hit form again," coach Ben Hollis said.<br />"The team played very well today."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Castlecliff Mustangs Black continued their winning ways beating Linton Bombers 14-10 and remain unbeaten in this round with one game left in the round.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Meanwhile, the mercy rule was used to save futher embarressment for a hapless Ezi Finance Whanganui Braves in its Manawatu Senior Men's Premier grade clash with Huia Chiefs on Saturday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Braves lost to a fired up Huia Chiefs outfit 13-0 in four innings when the mercy rule was applied.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was one of the heaviest defeats some team members can recall," player/coach Shane Foster said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Without regular pitcher Brad Worsley, who was picked up by North Harbour team Northcote for the NZ National Club Championships, Braves had to rely on veteran Foster to perform the pitching duties.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">However, Foster was merely batting practice for the unbeaten Huia Chiefs lineup with the rampant champions from last season sending an ominous message to whoever meets them in the final in two weeks, they are going to hit the ball hard.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">And on Saturday, Huia Chiefs hit the ball hard, everywhere. They exposed the Braves defense on numerous occasions forcing errors, but also found space, including an automatic home run.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">One positive from the game was some Braves batters were moving the ball.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Left handed lead batter Paddy Steele hit hard to centre right field for a two base hit, only to undo his hard work by over running second and be picked off by an impressive throw from the Huia Chiefs outfield.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Others were moving the ball on the deck too, which was promising for the make or break game against Bluesox this Saturday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The winner of this game will determine the other finalist for the 2018/2019 Premier Men's Championship, against Huia Chiefs on March 30.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Thankfully, regular hurler Worsley returns to the Braves pitching duties this weekend.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"There's no doubting that a good pitcher, especially one of Worsley's calibre, makes a difference to any team. We are blessed to have him and he will make the difference this weekend, I'm sure of that," Foster said.</p>
