<p><span><br />St Johns Club Whanganui Metro begin Manawatu Colts season with 26-17 win over Massey White.</span></p>
<p>St Johns Club Whanganui Metro had a shaky start to their Manawatu Colts rugby division season before dominating the second spell of their clash with Massey White in a home game on Spriggens Park on Saturday.</p>
<p>The defending champions ran out worthy 26-17 winners scoring four tries to three on dry track that marked the beginning of the season.</p>
<p>Mark Cosford, who co-coaches alongside Russell Gedye, said first game jitters may have been to blame for a messy first half where the Metro lads gave away too many penalties and unnecessary turnovers.</p>
<p>"Massey White dominated the first half, but we did give away too many penalties and turnovers," Cosford said.</p>
<p>"We came good in the second half and got the better of them. We wore them down and I think our fitness played a part. I thought our loose trio <strong>Mason Johnson, Coultin Wilson</strong> and No8 Louis Devine, who are old hands from last year, played well as did newcomers, second five <strong>Hayden Towers</strong> and centre <strong>Matt Murphy</strong> who scored two tries.</p>
<p>"It was a very satisfying way to start the season," Cosford said.</p>
