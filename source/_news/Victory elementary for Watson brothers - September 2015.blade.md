<p>Wanganui siblings Keightley, 14, and Callaghan Watson, 10, are heading in the right direction after a weekend in Auckland at the North Island Judo Championships.</p>
<p>Keightley Watson dominated not only the 66kg and over senior boys division, but the senior boys open weight, winning all his fights for a clean sweep of the North Island titles.</p>
<p>Younger brother Callaghan also dominated his weight group in the under-50kg junior boys winning all his fights and taking the North Island title. In the open-weight category, Callaghan fought well to secure bronze.</p>
<p>Both are now off to the Sydney International Judo Championships next week and then head to Tauranga for the New Zealand National Judo Championships.</p>
