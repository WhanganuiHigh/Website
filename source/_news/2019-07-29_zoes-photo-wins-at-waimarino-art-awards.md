The dictionary describes poison as a substance capable of causing the illness or death of a living organism when introduced or absorbed.

One Whanganui teenager used the term as the title of her photograph entered in the Waimarino Art Awards and left the definition open to interpretation.

Zoe Bracegirdle took about 60 photographs at various angles with her subject Mia Gilmore doing different poses to capture the perfect shot for the Poison picture.

Zoe was shocked when it was announced as the winning photograph in the young photography category at The Royal Theatre in Raetihi.

"I didn't even realise what had happened at first. I was just standing there and then I heard my name get called. When it sunk in, it felt great," Zoe says.

"There are times where you think 'I'm not going to bother with this' and it takes a lot to keep going, but this award has really helped me to keep running this race."
