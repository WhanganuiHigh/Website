<p><br />GJ Gardner Homes Wanganui Athletic have their revenge, but most importantly, they remembered how to have fun again on a football field in the 3-0 disposal of Hokowhitu FC at Skoglund Park on Saturday.</p>
<p>Well and truly down in the dumps after losing 2-1 to the same team in the second round of Lotto Federation Cup at Wembley Park last Monday, Athletic were allowed some time for self reflection by coach Jason King before kickoff.</p>
<p><span class="ellipsis">King told a quiet dressing room they did not need to change any tactics, given they knew their opposition very well, but what he really</span>&nbsp;<span class="QhgiTxHt0g">wanted was to see them having some fun again.</span></p>
<p class="QhgiTxHt0g">"Get back to why we play football in the first place. Don't get yourself too over serious."</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHt0g">The coach them left the players by themselves before the warmups, and was pleased to see they came out of the sheds in lighter spirits, joking around with each other.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHt0g">It worked, as Athletic controlled momentum for well over half of the match, while increasing their goal scoring output for the entire Lotto Federation League season by 38 percent.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHt0g">King was delighted.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHt0g">"Especially the way the game played out &ndash; the guys went out and played some of the best football they've played in a few games.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHt0g">"You sit and look at the result and think, 'how did we go down to this team five days ago'?"</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHt0g">Athletic got three shots on goal during the first nine minutes and the third attempt found the back of the net, courtesy of <strong>Scott Burney</strong>.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHt0g">Although the visitors could not add to their tally before halftime, creating a little nervousness as they have been up by a goal before this season, only to succumb by the finish, King said he kept his instructions light to maintain the positivity.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHt0g">Will King, new to the team this year, then scored in the 63rd minute, on a shot that Burney could have got a touch on if he wanted but pulled his foot back because it was heading over the goal line.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHt0g">Ryan Holden then wrapped the match up with his second goal in five days against the same team, scoring in the 78th minute.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHt0g">One of the Hokowhitu players had a head clash with Burney after Holden's goal, leaving the field for a concussion test, so the home team had to finish with ten on the pitch as they had already used up three reserves.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHt0g">However, King said Hokowhitu had already mentally checked out of the match by then.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHt0g">Athletic's second win of the League moved them to a 2-2-3 record in seventh spot, and does keep them in sight of home town rivals Versatile Wanganui City (3-1-3) in fifth.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHt0g">"Just the fact everyone was able to pick themselves back up. That was hugely satisfying to watch," said King.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHt0g">The team received another boost in support not long after kickoff due to the arrival of the GJ Gardner Homes Wanganui Athletic Reserves on their bus from nearby Celaeno Park.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHt0g">The winless Reserves had earlier pulled off the big upset, beating North End 3-2 in the Horizons Premiership, meaning it was quite the celebratory trip home for both squads before parking up at the Wanganui Athletic FC clubrooms for the evening.</p>
