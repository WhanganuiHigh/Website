<p><strong>Students were presented with their certificates by Sarah Hillary, daughter of Sir Edmund Hillary and a supporter of the Charity Work being done in her father&rsquo;s name in Nepal.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Later that evening, students attended a reception where they met with Dame Patsy Reddy.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It was a wonderful opportunity to acknowledge the work done by these young people over several years.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cameron</strong> noted that he was thankful for the opportunities that the scheme had given him, saying it was hard work, but he&rsquo;d enjoyed bonding with friends.</p>
<p><strong>Jackie</strong> thanked Whanganui High School for encouraging as many students as possible to take part in the programme.</p>
<p><strong>Kara</strong>, who completed her award after leaving school said that the award provides challenging experiences whilst creating friendships, and an opportunity for giving back to the community.</p>
<p><strong>Methmi</strong> learnt about perseverance and really loved the volunteering.</p>
<p><strong>Grace</strong> teamed up with her local Scout Group and is now a warranted leader and the Zone Kea leader for her zone.</p>
<p><strong><span>These awards highlight the huge amount of time and effort that has gone into completing the Gold award, and it is fitting that these students are honoured.</span></strong><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Whanganui High School congratulates all students who complete the award.</span></strong><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>A fine achievement indeed.</span></strong><strong></strong></p>
