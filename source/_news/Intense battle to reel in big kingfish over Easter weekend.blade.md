<p class="element element-paragraph "><br />It was a great Easter weekend break for local fisherman and ex WHS student Te Arepa Whareaitu, who hauled in a big kingfish at North Mole pier.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph ">The fish was caught around 8.30am on Good Friday, weighing in at 17 kilograms and was 1.1 metres long.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph ">On his first cast of the morning Whareaitu caught a kahawai and after recasting, it took about 15 minutes before the kingfish hooked on.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph ">"I thought I had caught the fish once it came closer, then it just took off again, I think that's when the other fishermen knew I was on to something good," Whareaitu said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph ">Speculation as to what was on the end of the line began to grow among the seven other fishermen there, as Whareaitu fought to bring it in.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph ">"I could hear some people assuming what type of fish it could be," Whareaitu said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph ">"My arms were on fire but after hearing that, I just wanted to get it in quickly and hope my line didn't break."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph ">In all it took half an hour to reel the kingfish to land.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph ">"It dragged me from the point of the Mole to the car park, I had to go over other people's rods just to keep it on the line.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph ">"I was only using was a 10 kilogram line and rod, and to have something on the other end that was well over 10 kilograms&hellip; I was just speechless when I saw it."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph ">Although the kingfish might not make it into the record books, it was a memorable catch for those who fish off the North Mole pier.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph ">"One fisherman said it was probably one of the biggest kingfish caught at the Mole, there was another guy who caught one a few years ago that was slightly smaller, they were saying."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph ">Whareaitu said he's a keen fisherman and the kingfish is the biggest fish he's ever caught.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph ">"It was such a rush landing it, I felt like I had won Lotto."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph ">Whareaitu shared some of the fish with those who helped him haul it in, and still had plenty for his family to feast on over the long weekend.</p>
