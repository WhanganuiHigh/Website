<h4>Māori Language Week 2018<strong> <br /></strong></h4>
<p><strong>10-16 September&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span>(This year&rsquo;s theme &lsquo;Kia Kaha te Reo Māori' -&nbsp;</span>Let&rsquo;s make M<span>ā</span>ori strong)</p>
<p><span>To support the promotion of Te Wiki o Te Reo M<span>ā</span>ori, we will be hosting a rock finding competition. This will be run by the M<span>ā</span>ori and Pasifika Heads and Prefects.</span></p>
<p><span>Placed around the Whare and A1 will be a number of painted rocks for students to come and find. They will have different M<span>ā</span>ori words written on them with new words available each day. The students will be free in their break to find the rocks and then they need to present them to the prefect team who will be located at the Whare&nbsp;and say what the english translation is for the Maori word they have on their rock. If correct the students will be given a prize.</span></p>
<p><span>We intend to run this right throughout the week with the Junior Te Reo students taking over when the seniors go on study leave.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em>Miss R Henry</em><br /><em>Head of Te Reo Māori</em></p>
