<p><strong>Our U15 team have done it again winning the Wanganui Rugby U15 grade against Cullinane on Wednesday 43-21.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>A great team effort with some outstanding team tries and conversions saw the boys take the&nbsp;win.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Well done to Coach Mike Lama and Assistant coach Ricky Winterburn.</strong></p>
