It was billed as the Bring on Summer gig - and the weather certainly played to the crowd.

You almost couldn't get a foot in the door at Caroline's Boatshed Bar as hundreds of people bathed in the sunshine on Sunday afternoon, relaxing to music from three local bands.

**The concert kicked off at 2pm with Whanganui High School band Rhythm Vision who played their own progressive rock-style material.**

**They were followed by Whanganui High School indie-pop band Ocean Loaf who played covers and their own material.**

The gig wrapped up with popular local band Whiskey Mama playing classic rock.
