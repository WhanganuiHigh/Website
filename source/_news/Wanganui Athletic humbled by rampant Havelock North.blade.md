<p><br />A man who once donned Wanganui Athletic red has returned to Wembley Park to haunt his former club.</p>
<p><strong>Tesco-Frederick Grunwald</strong> scored a brace and proved hard to contain as his Havelock North Wanderers hammered the home side 5-0 in Saturday's Federation League match.</p>
<p>The visitors - and early title contenders - scored after just 50 seconds before GJ Gardener Wanganui Athletic responded with a pleasing half of football against quality opposition.</p>
<p><span class="ellipsis">And they should have levelled things just before the break but instead Havelock North doubled their lead and went on to dominate the second spell with three unanswered goals.</span></p>
<p>"Second half they came out firing and we just didn't have any answers," Athletic coach Jason King said.</p>
<p>"Every team's going to have a humbling at some point and five goals is a bit of a humbling for us. We've only got one direction from here."</p>
<p>Athletic came into the 5th round match in sixth on their back of the first win of the season when they beat Massey University 3-2 a week earlier.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Havelock sat locked in a four-way tie at the summit of the ladder as the only unbeaten side in the league.</p>
<p>And their quality showed.</p>
<p>Havelock's opener came from the boot of <strong>Grunwald</strong> after he got his boot to a cross from <strong>Jared Bloor</strong> as the visitor's caught Athletic short before the first minute ticked over.</p>

<p><br />Athletic weren't stunned though and footed it with their more fancied opposition for the next 40 minutes, forging a string of opportunities and only being denied an equaliser by the post - twice.</p>
<p><strong>Jude Hiri</strong> forced a save out of Havelock North keeper Nick Hayward from close range while <strong>James Satherley</strong> sent several long-range shot sailing just wide of Havelock's goal.</p>
<p>Hayward was finally beaten in the 34th minute but there was still no way through for the home side.</p>
<p><strong>Satherley</strong> leaped to flick a header on from an Athletic free kick but as Hayward flailed the ball struck the right hand post.</p>
<p>And when Satherley caught the rebound with the boot, the ball hammered the cross bar.</p>
<p>Recalling that incident post-match produce a wry-smile form King who said it was the story of their season.</p>

<p><br />"If we got half a point for hitting the cross bar we'd be winning the league," he said.</p>
<p>"I think it took more effort for it not to go in than go in. It's just been one of those things. We had some great opportunities."</p>
<p>To add to Athletic's frustration, a defensive lapse let Bloor round Athletic keeper Calvert to make it 2-0 at the break.</p>
<p>Grunwald grabbed his brace four minutes into the second spell as the visitors stepped up a gear to wrest total control.</p>
<p>Bjorn Christensen scored Havelock's fourth from a free kick in the 73rd minute while sub Liam Shackleton completed Havelock's scoring.</p>
<p>"In the first half it was a really good game,' King said.</p>
<p>"[Early goals] happen. We should be still really been in the game. We just didn't respond well in the second half.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately that been a theme for us this season."</p>
<p>King said Athletic boosted the midfield to counter Havelock North's quality.</p>
<p>"We knew they played good football so it was about getting more bodies in the way," he said.</p>
<p>"Everybody had to work hard. We knew we were asking a lot of each other and I think they all tried to step us best they could within the circumstances."</p>
<p>Would an equaliser at 1-0 changed anything?</p>
<p>"You can speculate - of course it would've given those boys a bit of a lift knowing that they could break them down and having that mark on the score sheet saying 'you can do this'. But that's all speculation," King said.</p>
