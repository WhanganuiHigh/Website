<p><br />Whanganui real estate agent Lyn Wickham has made the wall of fame at Shine City and it is not for making sales.</p>
<p>When Wickham learned from her client Kylie Martin about the courses Shine City is delivering for Whanganui youth, she wanted to lend a hand and offered to donate a percentage of her fee from each sale.</p>
<p>"I'm very passionate about youth and the programmes Kylie described sounded pretty good to me.</p>
<p>"Depending on the prices of sales, I can offer around $300 to $500 from each one."</p>
<p>Shine City is a community organisation that delivers group mentoring and self-development programmes to the Whanganui community, to encourage and assist individuals to reach their potential.</p>
<p>"We are solely dependent on grants and fundraising so it is wonderful that Lyn wants to get behind what we do," said Martin.</p>
<p>"The programmes have a ripple effect in the community for families and friends as we encourage participants to help others reach their potential as well."</p>
<p>Inspired by a women's conference in 2011, the Whanganui group launched the ShineGirl self-development programme for intermediate-aged girls which has since included over 500 participants.</p>
<p>Courses for boys and women have followed with great success and in November last year, they held a successful fundraising evening at Frank Bar + Eatery to help fund courses.</p>
<p>Reducing youth suicide in Whanganui is an important focus for Shine City and they want to work with high school students to design and deliver courses that will build self-esteem and strong networks for teenagers.</p>
<p>Wickham who works for Bayleys in Whanganui has been having a busy year and is delighted to have the support of her "trusty personal assistant" Emma Tipper who has been with her for three months.</p>
<p>"Lyn is helping us out so we will return the favour by sharing her listings and recommending her services," said Martin.</p>
