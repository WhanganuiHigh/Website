On Saturday 2 November four of our students took part in the Big Bang Adventure Race 2019.

It was a beautiful day in the Kapiti region.  The race started at 8am with a mountain bike, then on to foot for a rogaine which took us up rivers and deep into the bush, then back on to bikes after a cliff jump and swim in the river, then the last leg was on foot which took us across the finish line. 

The team finished in a time of 4 hours and 42 minutes. 

WHS Results:

**4th out of 19 High School teams!**  
**16th overall out of 114 teams!** 

Really happy as the team was made up of two Year 9's (Chase Morpeth and George Davey â€“ another 4 years of racing in this event) and 2 year 12 students (Scott Emerson and Matt Grant).
