<p class="element element-paragraph"><br />Ezi Finance Wanganui Braves havemade the playoff for third in the Manawatu Senior Men's Premier grade softball competition after a narrow loss on Saturday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Braves went down to Bluesox 6-4 in a marathon game that went to eleven innings and took over three hours before a winner could be established.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Some spectators around Colquhoun Park in Palmerston North could not recall a more exciting game unfold. The game befitting a grand final some said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">After the regulation seven innings, the tense game was locked at one a piece.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The tie breaker rule was applied in the eighth inning and Bluesox went into bat first, scoring two runs. Braves responded with two runs of their own to Paddy Steele and Toby Rison.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The ninth inning was scoreless after both teams took some good outs.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The tenth inning saw Bluesox score another run. Again Braves responded with a run of there own to Marama Savage after Rison beat the play to first forcing Bluesox into an error. Savage was able to sneak home and Rison made second base.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The game was for the taking for Braves when Peter Flood also beat the play to first forcing Bluesox into another error. Rison attempted to steal home in the kerfuffle on first base but was tagged sliding into home plate. Some would argue Rison was safe as he clearly slid under the catchers glove. The umpire saw it differently and called Rison out on the tag.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The eleventh inning saw Bluesox score another two runs after forcing Braves into fielding errors. Braves could not respond at their turn at bat, and the game was over.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Some players could not recall ever playing eleven innings of softball.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Bluesox now play Huia Chiefs this Saturday for the Manawatu Premier Championship. Braves have been scheduled to play Linton for third place in the championship.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Meanwhile, <strong>Castlecliff Club Mustangs</strong> ended their season in Palmerston North with a healthy 9-2 win over Blue Sox Hitters to <strong>finish fourth</strong> of the13 teams in the Manawatu Senior Men's Reserve Grade softball competition.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Josh Hollis</strong> started the ball rolling when he hit to centre field. Hollis was scored when Jefferson Yacap hit to the outfield. Danny Green then scored Yacap with a safe hit, to give the "Stangs" a 2-0 lead. Mustangs next turn at bat saw Matty Ranga, <strong>Josh Hollis</strong>, Aaron Mahoney and Olly Dalton add to the score, to put the Stangs 6-0 ahead.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mustangs final turn at bat resulted in three more runs with Hollis brothers Jake and Ben hit safely and then Green hitting safely to load the bases. Ranga scored the Hollis boys then Cameron Hollis scored Ranga. Blue Sox scored two runs in their last bat. Pitching for Mustangs, Green handled the Blue Sox batting line up allowing four safe hits while taking seven strikeouts.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Castlecliff Club Mustangs Black team played a double header. First up was Linton Mustangs with the Black team coming out 15-3 winners. The second game had the Mustangs play promotion/relegation against Huia. Mustangs played their hearts out coming out 14-7 victors.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We now have both teams competing in the top section of the reserve grade next season," Black coach Shaun Pirere said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Mustangs would like to thank the Castlecliff Club for their great support throughout the season," a much appreciated Mustangs head coach Ron Hollis said.</p>
