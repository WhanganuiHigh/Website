<p><span>Whaling the theme for students art exhibition.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>Art teachers Vanessa Edwards from Rangitikei College and Graham Hall from Whanganui High School and their level 2 and 3 students worked on the same brief of an exhibition project and the results are on display at the Community Arts Centre in Taupo Quay.</span></p>
<p><span>The title of the exhibition is Te Whanau Puha &ndash; Whaling and runs until June 3.</span></p>
<p><span>The theme is New Zea</span><span class="text_exposed_show">land Whaling or the significance of the whale in New Zealand. Students independently researched and responded to this concept and created a large resolved painting or woodcut that would be assessed and exhibited in a public gallery.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Vanessa says &ldquo;The combination of the independent nature of the research and making, and exhibiting with other students from another school in a public arena creates a unique and authentic space for the students to practice their creative process and see their work in a real world context. Each work is assessed and can gain students 4 credits to go towards their NCEA Qualification.&rdquo;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">She adds &ldquo;We are teaching to an unknown future and need to build confidence and resilience in our young people to put themselves out there to celebrate their successes and reflect on their failures. This project creates an authentic space for students to see their work beyond an NCEA assessment grade.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">This is the second exhibition that Vanessa and Graham have worked on together and want to grow this concept to include other schools in the future.</span></p>
