<p>St Johns Hill School Year 6 students and staff set our Whanganui High School Art students, the challenge to create the backdrop and props for their upcoming &ldquo;The Amazing Adventures of Superstan&rdquo; Musical, in a Pop Art style.</p>
<p>The Year 6 Musical is being held at St Johns Hill School on Tuesday 6 and Wednesday 7 December at 7pm.</p>
<p>Miss Sleyer&rsquo;s Year 11 Art class jumped at the challenge and worked furiously on the designs, then Miss Brown&rsquo;s Year 10 Art class completed the project.</p>
<p>The staff and students are grateful for their fantastic efforts.</p>
