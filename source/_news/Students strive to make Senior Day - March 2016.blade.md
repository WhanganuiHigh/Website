<p>Year 9 and 10 students had goals&nbsp;to&nbsp;aspire&nbsp;to&nbsp;during yesterday's Wanganui High School Junior Athletics<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Day&nbsp;at Cooks Gardens.</p>
<p>WHS sports co-ordinator Lisa Murphy said the day was compulsory for all Year 9 and 10 students who competed in a range of disciplines.</p>
<p>"We have about 600 kids here competing in five field events, including shot put, discus, javelin, high jump and long jump as well as running races on the track. We have set benchmarks in each discipline and all students who meet or surpass those benchmarks qualify&nbsp;to&nbsp;compete in the&nbsp;Senior&nbsp;Athletics&nbsp;Day&nbsp;at Cooks Gardens on Thursday next week," Murphy said.</p>
<p>"At the&nbsp;Senior&nbsp;Day&nbsp;they could potentially be selected<strong>&nbsp;to</strong>&nbsp;represent the school at the Whanganui Secondary School Championships, so there's a fair bit of incentive for students with a bit of athletic flair. Everyone, though, is encouraged&nbsp;<strong>to</strong>&nbsp;participate at today's event where they can compete as individuals or for their form class."</p>
<p>Murphy said results from yesterday's junior day would take a few days&nbsp;to&nbsp;collate.</p>
