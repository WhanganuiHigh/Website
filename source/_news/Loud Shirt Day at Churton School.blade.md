<p><span>The photograph shows students in Room 6, along with their teacher and former WHS student, Georgia Flower, giving a big shout out in support of a friend with a hearing impairment.</span></p>
<p>Students at Churton School celebrated Loud Shirt Day in style last week. They made the last day of term a colourful event and raised over $100 to support The Hearing House and the Southern Cochlear Implant Paediatric Programme.</p>
<p>Both of these are charities that work to enable deaf children with cochlear implants or hearing aids to listen and speak like their hearing peers. Neither charity charges deaf children or their families for their services so fundraising events such as Loud Shirt Day are vitally important to them.</p>
