<p><span><strong>WHS Y9 Jack Overweel competed at the Manfeild 6 Hour Challenge</strong> last weekend in a "Wanganui boys team" with Hunter Gibson and Logan Hoskin from Collegiate in the pouring rain, wind and hail to take out <strong>3rd&nbsp;</strong> <strong>place in the Year 9/10 schools team</strong> race completing 72 laps at 3km each lap in 6 hours. </span></p>
<p><span>Awesome effort, the three boys train together twice a week on the road.</span></p>
<p><span>Well done Jack!</span></p>
