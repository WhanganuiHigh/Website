<p class="element element-paragraph"><br />While the kids are out hunting for chocolate eggs, GJ Gardner Homes Wanganui Athletic and Versatile Wanganui City FC will be hunting vital wins this Easter.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Both teams are heading into the third round of the Federation League winless having lost by one goal last weekend and drawing against each other in round one.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">City player/coach Anthony Bell said a win against Hokowhitu FC at Wembley Park this Saturday would do wonders for his team's confidence.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We are going out to grab three points and our goal this season is to make Wembley Park a fortress," Bell said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's a picturesque park to play football at and we are ready to show our supporters what we can do. We are going to make it tough for teams to come here and take points off us."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">City went down narrowly against Napier Marist in Hawkes Bay last Sunday, conceding a goal in the last 20 minutes making the final score 3-2.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Bell was pleased with how his team got back in the game despite going down 1-0 early, especially considering the travel factor and the fact they only had one substitute.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Helping to rectify that issue with player numbers is the return of Zane Robinson following his suspension for a red card in round one.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Bell said the mood at training on Tuesday night was positive and the team talked about what they need to work on moving forward.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Having trust in each other's ability is important. We had a really strong pre-season going unbeaten in three games and we want to recapture that form," Bell said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We want to go back to playing our style of football which we haven't done in the previous weeks."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">That style involves retaining possession, working on the final ball and relaxing when delivering it.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Despite Hokowhitu having struggled to start the season, City don't take any opponent for granted, Bell said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They may have lost two games, but they're not going to come out and sit down and take three losses on the chin.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We are expecting them to come out firing. We need to be smart about it. If we do click and gather that final ball, we've got the ability to put a good handful of goals away."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The game begins at Wembley Park at 2.45pm, the same time as play will get underway for Athletic who are taking on Red Sox Manawatū at Skoglund Park in Palmerston North.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Following last weekend's agonising 2-1 loss to North End AFC, Athletic coach Jason King might be forced to dip into the talent of the reserve squad.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The team has lost Josh Parker for the season after he took up a job in Wellington and they are sweating on the fitness of Jordan Gilmore who took an ankle knock.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"There are some guys we might take away with us and blood in this game. It will be good for them and it will be interesting to see how they respond on the pitch," King said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"If we're going to grow these youngsters and give them good opportunities, we've just got to get them out there on the park at some point."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">King reiterated his heartbreak at his side letting in an injury time goal at Wembley Park last weekend to miss out on a point to add to their season tally.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">However, he remained pleased with the performance overall after he had made big positional changes within the squad.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We created some good opportunities, we just didn't take them. We created those chances, we put one away, but we were taking other chances that went slightly wide," King said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Unfortunately, slightly wide doesn't get on the scoresheet. It's not Aussie Rules where they give you a consolation point for going wide."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Manawatū side is sitting in third spot on the table, claiming all six points available to them with two wins to start the season.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">King said the opposition are a bit of an unknown and his side won't know how they play until they get out there on the day.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"This weekend is important to us, but every weekend is. It's a long season to go, this is only game three of 16 rounds," he said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We'll continue taking steps forward. I know we've got goals in us and I know we've got wins in us. I'm confident we'll finish off where we want to be."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Athletic and City sit seventh and eight on the table respectively with one point each.</p>
