My name is Shea Robinson and I am a team leader for Team DMNZ (Drift Motorsport NZ). Team DMNZ is a husband and wife couple who professionally drift all over the world. 

I recently returned from a trip to U.S.A. with my team. The trip was very valuable from a team leader perspective as we attended a round of the Formula Drift Championship in Dallas, Texas. The opportunity was given to us to attend the event as RTR Motorsports team members. This provided us with the chance to see the behind the scenes of the event, so we could note valuable information and data to use in the future. Alongside attending the event, I was also involved in many meetings discussing sponsorship opportunities. One of the meetings was with “Rad” Dan Burkett at his workshop, Rad Industries, in LA. Dan currently competes in the Pro class of Formula Drift, and is a true icon of sport. 

Since arriving back home, my team and I have been working hard to secure sponsorship to allow us to send two cars to compete in Formula Drift next year.
