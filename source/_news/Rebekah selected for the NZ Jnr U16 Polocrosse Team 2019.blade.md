<h3>Rebekah Phillips selected for the New Zealand Junior Under 16 Polocrosse Team 2019!</h3>
<p>Back in January, four girls and four boys were selected to play over two weekends against visiting teams from Australia - New South Wales (26/27 Jan) and Queensland (9/10 March).</p>
<p>New Zealand won a game and lost a game to Queensland, on count back - were placed runners up.</p>
<p><strong>Rebekah was also selected as one of three Under 16 New Zealand players to receive a New Zealand Polocrosse scholarship</strong>, which enables her to travel to Australia later this year, staying with an Australian family for about 2 weeks, playing polocrosse and developing her riding and playing skills.</p>
<p>Her sister Lauren, was also selected in the New Zealand development squad that trialled for the Junior team, earlier this summer.</p>
<p>Congratulations Rebekah!&nbsp; Superb effort, all that hard work has paid off!<br />Also congratulations to Lauren for her selection in the NZ development squad.</p>
