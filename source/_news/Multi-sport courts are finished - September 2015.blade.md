<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">WHS Multi-sport courts are finished!!</span></p>
<p><span> We have 6 tennis courts, 5 netball courts, half a hockey turf and 6 basketball hoops &amp; backboards around the outside. Just a few tennis nets and hockey goal net to be put up. We also have a fitness test area for our PE staff to test the students with the beep test. </span></p>
<p><span>This multi-sport complex will be used throughout summer and winter by our sports teams and PE staff for classes. A lot of hard work and big decisions has gone into this project. Thank you to everyone who has been part of it!</span></p>
