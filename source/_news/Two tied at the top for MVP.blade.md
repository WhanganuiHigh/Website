<p><strong>Both&nbsp;Tasman Tanning Premier Whanganui Rugby MVP's were former Whanganui High School students.</strong></p>
<p>Two players will share the spoils after tying for first in the coveted Tasman Tanning Premier Whanganui Rugby Grand Irish Bar Most Valuable Player Award this season.</p>
<p>Harvey Round Motors Ratana prop&nbsp;<strong>Shade Tuaine-Whanau</strong>&nbsp;and Wanganui Car Centre Kaierau halfback&nbsp;<strong>Cameron Davies</strong>&nbsp;could not be separated on 15 points apiece after Week 13.&nbsp; Players are voted on by opposition team management each week throughout the competition.&nbsp; Ironically, neither player will be facing off in the semi-finals this coming weekend.</p>
<p>Tuaine-Whanau and Davies will share the $500 voucher prize put up by the Grand Hotel.</p>
