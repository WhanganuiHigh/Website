<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WHS ATHLETICS DAY</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>School athletics this year at Whanganui High School was another successful year for the whole school. Having our four houses Awa, Maunga, Moana and Whenua made the day exciting with plenty of competitiveness and school spirit amongst everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The competitive races were an eye opener to what an amazing job coach Greg Fromont and assistant coach Elaine Baker have done with our athletes here at Whanganui High School. Every race was extremely close with everyone giving 110% and showing great sportsmanship towards each other. A school record was broken by Rebecca Baker first time in Senior Girls 1500m. This was last set in 1998 by Sarah McLeod with a time of 4.44.09 with Rebecca Baker breaking this at 4.40.08. Overall the school Athletics Day was a huge success and a great way to continue a new era.&nbsp;</p>
<p>WHS had 80 athletes compete at the WSS with a selection of them being named in the North Island Secondary School Wanganui Athletic Team to compete in April in Tauranga.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HIGH ACHIEVERS</span></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rose Hird</strong></p>
<p>At the prestigious 2019 Patillo Whanganui Arts Review, Rose claimed the Whanganui District Council Youth Committee Youth Recognition Award for her painting called &lsquo;Rōhi&rsquo;. This is the third year in a row for Whanganui High School.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Adrienne Hunt</strong></p>
<p>Adrienne has been selected as a member of the NZ Education Youth Advisory Groups for 2019, chosen for her unique perspective and her interest in improving pathways for young people to meet their goals and aspirations.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jack Overweel</strong></p>
<p>Fantastic results for Jack Overweel at the Cycling Age Group Track Nationals this month. Jack demonstrated a mix of speed, skill and tatics to secure one gold, and three silver medals in the under 15 age events. This is New Zealand&rsquo;s premier national track cycling event for riders from U15 through to Masters and only the top riders are selected for this race event.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>James Rountree</strong></p>
<p>Our motocross champion James Rountree has had outstanding results at three recent events. He won the Junior division at the Whakatane Summercross Competition, then collected two first places at Taranaki&rsquo;s King of the Mountain event (in 14-15 years&rsquo; 250cc class and 15-16 years&rsquo; 125cc class). Continuing his successful streak, at the NZ Grand Prix he picked up two silver medals in these classes and he is also New Zealand&rsquo;s FIM Oceania Representative! Well done, James.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Renee Teers</strong></p>
<p>At the recent Speed Skating Asian Championships, Renee Teers gained two top 10 places in the Junior Womens U19 1000m Sprint Final and 20K Elimination. This is on top of her success at the NZ Banked Track National Champs in Timaru where she gained one gold, and 3 silver places for Intermediate Womens events.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">He Kahukura -</span></strong><strong></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Making stronger connections with Whānau<br /></span></strong><em>Partnership - Protection - Participation</em></p>
<p>Whanaungatanga (relationships)&nbsp;is at the heart of our teaching and learning. Help us to support the student-school-home relationship. &nbsp;Our belief, our journey &ldquo;You succeed, We succeed&rdquo;.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Want to know more?</p>
<ul>
<li>Watch out for our next Rangatahi Hui and Kai Hui to hear from rangatahi about your aspirations and what would make a difference; your voice.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Ask a teacher at parent-teacher- student conferences what we can do for you</li>
<li>Ring and speak with one of our He Kahukura team.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>With you and your child we can encourage success<strong> </strong>for your child by using korero and a <em>Whānau Education Action Plan. </em>&nbsp;The He Kahukura team, teachers or Deans can take steps to set up successful ways for whānau and staff to work together with a focus on student learning, behaviour and engagement.</p>
<p><em>Whānau Education Action Plans </em>provide opportunities for all akonga.<em> </em>When as whānau you share your plans for education success we are more likely to achieve student goals collectively. Our focus is to meet the needs of all of our rangitahi. We want to ensure that Ngā iwi learners achieve success as Ngā Iwi. We need your support to do this.</p>
<p>We value and continue to develop our Partnership between local iwi and kura. Whanganui High School also works collaboratively between each Secondary kura, sharing our journeys, successes and best practice.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PB4L (Positive Behaviour for Learning)</span></strong></p>
<p>As a PB4L (Positive Behaviour for Learning) School, Whanganui High School has the four Life values &ndash; Learning, Integrity, Fellowship and Excellence. Learning focuses on &lsquo;Being Prepared&rsquo; and &lsquo;Participation&rsquo;, Integrity focuses on &lsquo;Being Responsible&rsquo; and &lsquo;Showing Respect&rsquo;, Fellowship focuses on &lsquo;Cooperation&rsquo; and &lsquo;Encouraging Others&rsquo; and &lsquo;Excellence&rsquo; focuses on &lsquo;Doing Your Best&rsquo; and &lsquo;Celebrating Success&rsquo;. Staff are involved in ensuring that the school environment is positive and supportive, expectations are clear and that students are taught desired behaviours. Desired behaviours are acknowledged in a number of ways both informally by individual staff members and formally via our Recognitions system which is recorded on our School Management System, KAMAR. When students have difficulty making positive choices, staff provide relevant support and also record this on KAMAR. Three times a term a summary of attendance, recognitions and behaviour entries is forwarded to students and their caregivers. We are really excited this year to have established a PB4L Student Team who currently meet once a fortnight and have some great initiatives they are currently working on.&nbsp;</p>
