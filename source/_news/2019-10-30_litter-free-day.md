Litter Free Lunch Day was held again during Term three. Thirteen schools took part, we had a great response from all involved and loved hearing how each school ran their day. This year we had two secondary schools take part in the day; Whanganui Girls College and **Whanganui High School**. Both schools did a great job tying this into the climate change strike and promoting the day within their school.  We had a number of schools visit us throughout the term to learn more about litter free lunches. There were picnics, shared lunches, house competitions and sausage sizzles. A big thank you to the Whanganui District Council, our sponsors and all the students and staff who embraced the day. 

Comvita also came and ran a free afternoon workshop on how to make a honey wrap for some lucky followers of our Facebook page. 

If your school is interested in learning more about litter free lunches then book in for a visit or contact us for more information.
