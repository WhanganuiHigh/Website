<p>For our Valentine&rsquo;s Day event, a group of 18 prefects including the Head&rsquo;s of Social, gathered together on selling days as well as the prepping process in sorting the Chocolate Cupcakes and Roses.<br /><em>Photos / courtesy of&nbsp;Jack Donaldson, Deputy Head Boy</em></p>
<p>Through advertising on social media and school assemblies, an immense amount of treats were delivered on Valentine&rsquo;s Day morning!</p>
<p>From teachers to students, love and positivity was shared along with smiles on this special day of the year.</p>
<p>From us to you, we hope we made it all the more happier (and even yummier) for you!</p>
<p><em>By Ella Dudley</em><br /><em>Head of Social&nbsp;</em></p>
