<p class="element element-paragraph">Former WHS students' Josh and Jake Hollis and Rikki Leigh Madams are all doing well in Softball.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui softballers had contrasting fates in the Manawatu league in Palmerston North over the weekend.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Whanganui Castlecliff Mustangs turned the tables on Huia at their second encounter for the season in the Manawatu Senior Men's Reserve grade, while Ezi Finance Braves had a shocker in the premier division against Raiders.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Huia batted first scoring two runs and in reply Mustangs scored one and kept Huia scoreless for the next two innings before the Mustangs batters went to work.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Josh Hollis</strong> hit safely, Jeff Yacap then hit deep to the outfield with an awkward bounce beating the outfielder for both runners to score. Runs continued to flow as Petera Rurawhe Martin, Cameron Hollis, Danny Green and Tewha Martini all recorded safe hits to take the visitors to a 7-2 lead.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Huia were next to score with four runs added to their tally. The Mustangs held a narrow one run lead.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mustangs, in their final turn at bat, had home runs scored by Yacap, his second of the day,<strong> Jake Hollis</strong>, Matty Ranga, and Regan Calder and along with Lenox Folds' single gave the Whanganui side a 13-6 win.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Coach Ron Hollis said this was pleasing result for the Mustangs as Huia was the victor last time the two teams met.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Petera Rurawhe Martin took some fantastic catches in difficult conditions while Danny Green pitched facing 18 batters and striking out nine," Hollis said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Meanwhile, the two Mustangs girls on loan to the Huia women's team played out of their skins on Saturday. Krystell Rurawhe Martin collected a couple of safe hits, while <strong>Rikki Leigh Madams</strong> batted 1000. These two girls are in their first year of fastpitch."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui Mustangs play Levin United this weekend.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Meanwhile, Ezi Finance Wanganui Braves Braves fell apart to lose 15-5 in the 7th innings to Raiders in the Manawatu Senior Men Premier division.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Coming off a default the week before and with Brad Worsley pitching for North Harbour at the National Fastpitch Championships in Christchurch at the weekend, Braves pitching duties were left to veteran player/coach Shane Foster.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The game was anybodys until the top of the 7th when a tiring Foster, pitching his first game of the season, could not hold off the Raiders batters who scored 7 runs. Braves could not respond at their last turn at bat.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Braves defense was truly tested for the first time this season with the Raiders batters hitting hard in all directions, creating pressure and errors from the outset," Foster said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"One cannot deny the Raiders batters where on form, with their pitcher hitting two automatics and others hitting to the fence."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Down three runs after the first innings Braves rallied in the second to get four home of their own to Foster, Glen Casey, Marama Savage and Kajah Hunapo. The latter two having excellent games with the bat. Hunapo scored Braves only other run in the fourth, however Braves could not get the bat going after that.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Worsley makes a welcome return this weekend when Braves take on the army men, Linton at 12.30pm on Saturday.</p>
