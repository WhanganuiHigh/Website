<p><br />Intensity was the difference when St Johns Club Whanganui Metro lost 40-8 to Feilding Yellow in the ManawatÅ« Colts rugby competition on the weekend.</p>
<p>Whanganui Metro's level of intensity dropped in the second half after a very competitive first half left them trailing 14-3 at Macnab Domain in Kaiwhaiki.</p>
<p>Co-coach Mark Cosford said a couple of early mistakes when the latter half began led to competition leaders Feilding Yellow getting on top of his side.</p>
<p>"They had a bit more intensity than we did and in the second half they just showed us the level that we've got to be at really," Cosford said.</p>
<p>"Our level's just got to lift a little bit more to be competitive. We're fully aware that we've got a young side that are pretty green compared to all the other teams."</p>
<p>Whanganui Metro retained just five players from last year's championship winning team who beat College Old Boys 33-0 in Palmerston North.</p>
<p>As well as gaining plenty of new young players for this 2019 season, coaches Cosford and Russell Gedye are also new to the fold.</p>
<p>Cosford praised his players returning from injury <strong>Mason Johnson</strong> and man of the match Louis Devine.</p>
<p>"They went really well and the young guys are coming along. They're all lifting to the level we're aiming to be at.</p>
<p>"We know where we've got to be and it's up to us to improve mentally to get there."</p>
<p>The loss left Whanganui Metro fifth on the competition ladder, one point out of the top four on 16 heading into the final match of round one.</p>
<p>They will take on second-to-last placed Massey Ag XV at Massey University in Palmerston North on Saturday, kicking off at 12.45pm.</p>
<p>"[The Massey Univeristy Rugby Football Club] have got their 90th anniversary so it's going to be a hard game and they'll have everyone on deck," Cosford said.</p>
<p>"Our breakdown got dominated by Feilding on the weekend, we've got to start dominating the breakdown if we want to beat them."</p>
