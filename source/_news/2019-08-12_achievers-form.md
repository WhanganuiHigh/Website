ðŸŽ¯ Re: ALL Achieving Students ðŸŽ¯

Whanganui High School likes to congratulate our students who do well in their academic, sport and cultural areas of their lives. We have Achievers Assembly once a term and a press release acknowledging significant achievements once a term in the River City Press.

For students to be recognized for their successes students must fill in an Achievers Form from the Student Centre or go onto the following bitly site and fill in the form.

This is very important so we do not miss any important news about our students.
