<p>Whanganui High School students are busy rehearsing for the 2016 Stage Challenge production '29 Below' ahead of the premier performance at Wanganui Opera House on Monday night.</p>
<p>Teacher Natalie Campbell said the production is a collaboration between teachers and students exploring the theme of New Zealand mining disasters.</p>
<p>"The Year 13 students have done most of the choreography," she said.</p>
<p>Ms Campbell said the school contacted Pike River Mine families spokesman Bernie Monk and received the feedback that the group was pleased to see the issue of mine safety represented by students.</p>
<p>After three months of rehearsals, the cast of 120 will perform before a Whanganui audience ahead of competing in the regional Stage Challenge final in Palmerston North on May 27.</p>
<p>Tickets for '29 Below' can be purchased from the student centre at Whanganui High School or from the Opera House at $12 for adults and $8 for students.</p>
