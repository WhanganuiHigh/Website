<p><br />Whanganui Roller Derby League the &lsquo;West Coast Bombers&rsquo; will once again host their foremost &lsquo;Roller Derby Event: All Day Derby&rsquo; on the 22 June 2019 at Jubilee Stadium. This is the third annual running of this event comprising of eight teams in four full length roller derby match-ups. This year the West Coast Bombers have decided to make the day a free entry event, however they will accept a koha or canned<span class="text_exposed_show">&nbsp;food item which will be passed on to a local charity.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Fast paced and action packed, Roller Derby is a contact sport played on quad skates on an indoor track. Each of the four full length games will promise thrills, skills and spills, all easily viewed from the comfort of Jubilee Stadiums indoor grandstands. The free entry will allow spectators to come and go as they feel throughout the day, with doors opening at 10:30am.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">The Saturday promises an action packed line up with West Coast Bombers all-female team the &lsquo;Night Witches&rsquo; rolling out to take on the formidable Taranaki Roller derby &lsquo;The Rumble Bees&rsquo; at 11am.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">At 1pm, the West Coast Bombers &lsquo;Squadron&rsquo; mixed gender team take on old Rivals &lsquo;Hellminton&rsquo; from the Waikato. Historically, these battles have been complete nail biters: hopefully this one will be no different.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">At 3pm is a New Zealand top ten clash between West Coast Bombers&rsquo; sister league, &lsquo;Whenua Fatales&rsquo; and the ladies in pink from Bay City Rollers. This promises to be a showcase of some of the best skills in New Zealand and is one not to be missed.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">The finale at 5pm is the all male match-up where the Northern Gentlemen take on the No City Skaters. Previous years have had each team take a win and so who will take out this best of three? A hard hitting, rough and tough bash &ndash; a real treat to watch!<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">The West Coast Bombers ask people to come support the local teams, bring comfy chairs and cushions and drop by, or settle in for a day of high class derby action.<br /></span></p>
