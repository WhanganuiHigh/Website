<p>WHS had a team of seven boys competing in the 2018 New Zealand Secondary School National 8-Ball Championships in Hamilton on Friday 7 September.</p>
<p>Kaleb-Lee Taylor, Owen Parkinson, Sean Tighe, Brandon Kidd, Benji Kidd, Ben Fantham and Ethan Scott had an early start leaving Whanganui at 5am on Friday. We arrived at 9.30am to practise new VNEA rules and different size tables for a tough NZ schools competition.&nbsp; We had been preparing on RSA tables under Club rules.</p>
<p><strong>After an awesome start we were eventually eliminated and played in the Plate competition and gained first and second place winning pool cues for our efforts.</strong></p>
<p>Overall a successful tournament and a bright future for our pool players.</p>
