<p><em>Whiskey Mama</em> will be playing at the&nbsp;<span>&lsquo;So Long Summer&rsquo; concert at Caroline&rsquo;s Boatshed on Sunday 17 March 2019.</span></p>
<p><span>Caroline&rsquo;s Boatshed at 181 Somme Parade is following up its very successful &lsquo;Rock the River&rsquo; concert of January 6, with another concert on March 17. It is a bit of a farewell to summer under the banner of &lsquo;So Long Summer&rsquo; concert and will include a selection of Irish music in recognition of St Patrick&rsquo;s Day on March 17.</span></p>
<p><span>The concert starts at 2pm and the three bands will perform from a stage on a truck in the carpark a</span><span class="text_exposed_show">rea. This provides a clear view, a great sound and security for everyone.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">The Whanganui band &lsquo;Hot Potato&rsquo; will start the concert. Well known musician, Fred Loveridge, describes them as a &ldquo;band which plays virtually all acoustic style except for an electric base and piano, with good strong vocals. They have a skiffle band style which reminds audiences of British skiffle bands of the 1960s such as the music of Lonnie Donegan. They are fun and entertaining.&rdquo;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">From 3 to 4pm approximately, it will be an Irish hour with Celtic violin player, Liz Newton and her group &lsquo;Uncle Malachi,&rsquo; &ndash; good toe tapping stuff and great to accompany a Guinness or two. Then it will be the turn of well-known classic rockers, <strong>Whiskey Mama with Fred Loveridge</strong>, to continue through until the early evening.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">There is no entry cost and the Boatshed bar and restaurant will be open. Fred says, &ldquo;Rock the River concert went so well that Caroline&rsquo;s are planning to make both concerts an annual event.</span></p>
