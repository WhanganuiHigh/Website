<p><span><strong>Ben Hollis</strong> (ex student) had a great day with the bat for Mustangs smashing three automatic home runs during his side's 13-4 drubbing of Linton in Palmerston North on Saturday.</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">All three Whanganui softball teams had solid victories in their respective Manawatu senior men softball divisions in Palmerston North at the weekend.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ezi Finance Wanganui Braves won their double header games against Linton 10-1 and Raiders 5-1 in the premier grade, while Mustangs beat a strong Linton line-up 13-4 and Mustangs Black got the better of Feilding Top Guns 11-3 in the men's reserve grade match-ups</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In the first game of the day for Braves, pitcher Brad Worsley tied up the young Linton army team in the batters box, striking out 13 of the 17 batters in the lopsided five-inning game.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Lead-off batter <strong>Paddy Steele</strong> did his job, getting two walks to score two runs in the game. He was ably supported in the batters box by veteran Peter Flood, Kajah Hunapu, big <strong>Stephen Barnes</strong> and Ricky Boniface.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The highlight of the game was two back-to-back home runs in the top of the third innings by Barnes and Boniface to effectively nail the lid on the Linton army men's coffin.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Braves' second encounter of the day against Raiders was a tighter affair in the late afternoon match. Both teams were locked on one-all for the first three innings.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Braves' first run came when Boniface was walked, made second base when the Raiders made an error attempting to pick off Boniface on first, and was brought home from a nice hit to centre field by Toby Rison.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The game swung in Braves' favour in the top of the fourth when Boniface and Glen Casey made base with hits to the outfield. They were brought home once again by Rison who hit to centre left field. Rison made home from third base from a pass ball past the Raiders catcher to have Braves leading 4-1.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Braves' other run came in the top of the sixth when Worsley made base due to a Raiders centre field error. He impressively stole second base, then stole third and score on a fielders choice. Again Worsley dominated the Raiders batting line up taking 15 strike outs.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><span>Braves took some nice outs on defence too, with one of the better plays seen in the infield this year by shortstop Rison, who turned a double taking out the runner to second and throwing to first to complete the double play, and an excellent catch by Boniface who had to cover some real estate and dive to take a good catch at left field.</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Braves have a bye round this weekend, and play Bluesox the following weekend at 2.30pm in Palmerston North.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mustangs played the strong Linton team.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In the first innings Jefferson Yacap pounded the ball deep in the out field for a home run to give Mustangs the lead. Linton replied with three runs in the second innings. At the top of the fourth Ben Hollis sent the ball into space for a huge automatic home run. Linton added another run in their fifth bat.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In Mustangs sixth turn at bat, Trent Hemi hit safely, then Ben Hollis added a big home run to score Hemi and himself. Petera Rurawhe Martin and Tewha Martini Richards both hit safely to have first and second loaded.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Duane Paranihi added another home run, hitting deep to right field to score both runners and himself. Josh Hollis and Paranihi, adding his second run, gave Mustangs a 9-4 lead.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In the seventh innings Trent Hemi and Ben Hollis both hit automatics. <strong>Jake Hollis</strong> hit safely, Regan Calder slammed the ball deep in the outfield for the eighth home run of the day to score Hollis and himself.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Trent Hemi</strong> had another good day on the pitching mound, allowing four hits and a walk.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Meanwhile, Mustangs Black had a solid 11-3 win over Fielding Top Guns. Young pitcher Tyrone Pirere kept the Top Gun batters at bay, while the experience of Aaron Mahony catching helped the young pitcher.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Devon Maihi, Johnny Kiwara, Pirere, Mahony and James Rapana all featured with the bat.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Coach Shaun Pirere said he was pleased with his young troopers.</p>
