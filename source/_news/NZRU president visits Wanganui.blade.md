<p data-bind="text: $data"><br />It did not take long for new NZRU president and former WHS student&nbsp;<strong>Bill Osborne</strong> to visit Wanganui, his city of birth.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">He was a guest at the Kaierau club on Anzac Day night during a stop-over from his home in Tauranga to Wellington to watch the Hurricanes play the Chiefs. Bill is a former Chiefs board member.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">It was fitting that he should be at Kaierau on April 25 because the Osborne families have a long connection with the Country Club including his late father William Aperahana Te Kiira Peina Potaka Osborne.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">William Snr, who died in 2012 at 96, used to take his son to local Anzac Day services. The father was the last local survivor of the 28th Ma&macr; ori Battalion that served in World War II. He was shot five times in action and rose to Acting Captain on the way back to New Zealand.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">William Snr, who lived his early years on the Whanganui River, played rep rugby for King Country and while overseas played for the Ma&macr; ori Forces in London with the team using a wrapped up brick during training because there were no rugby balls available.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">He regularly enjoyed a few beers at Kaierau, the RSA club plus the old Federal and Commercial hotel, in his latter years riding into the city on his mobility scooter. He was helping cut firewood for friends and family into his 90s.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data"><strong>Bill Osborne Jnr</strong> is not only remembered at Kaierau for his playing ability for the club, Wanganui and for the All Blacks. He has a lasting legacy at the Country Club with 16 of his prized playing jersey collection, from all the international teams he played against including World XVs in mounted display cases around the lounge bar area.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Over the past two years he has visited a few overseas countries and numerous New Zealand rugby unions as NZRU vice president but 2019 will be a highlight because he will be in Japan as president when the All Blacks defend the World Cup in September. Next season he hopes to travel to Europe on the end of season tour.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Being national president of one of the largest and most successful rugby unions in the world, with a flood of requests for his presence, makes for a very demanding and tight year round schedule.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">He was very impressed with the way the Kaierau club has expanded to include netball, a boxing and training gymnasium and an archery range, saying it was an example for other rugby clubs to follow instead of just catering solely for rugby teams</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">It was great to see a small upper North Island club supplying basic hot meals to the wider community at a token charge. This initiative proved very popular, especially with older town residents who were able to meet frequently. The meals also helped boost interest in the club and the image of rugby.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data"><strong>Bill Osborne</strong>, who was presented with a new Kaierau club playing jersey, quipped he might have to lose a little weight.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">He spent time with the Kaierau premier and senior training squads during his few hours at the club, pointing out the value of regular practice sessions to refine team tactics, movements and to improve fitness.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data"><em><strong>Finalists meet</strong></em></p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Defending Tasman Tanning premier champions McCarthy Transport Ruapehu make a first Wanganui city appearance for the season on Saturday, against Black Bull Liquor Pirates in a repeat of last year&rsquo;s final at Cooks Gardens.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Ruapehu won that game 41-17 to avenge a 23-17 loss in 2014, the last time the two clubs contested the final. They also met in the 2013 final at Spriggens Park with the visitors winning 16-13. The clubs have contested three finals in the 41-year history of the union-wide combined championship.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Since 2012, when Phillip Morris switched coaching from Wanganui Car Centre Kaierau to Pirates, the city side has won seven games, drew 16-all at home in 2013 and been beaten nine times. Ruapehu had won 11 on the trot leading up to 2012.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Ruapehu has been in sharp form this year, being the only unbeaten team after three rounds although the champions were hard pressed to hold off Byford&rsquo;s Readimix Taihape 8-5 at O&macr; hakune last weekend.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">On Saturday Pirates recovered from a 17-0 deficit to finally be pipped 21-20 by Harvey Round Motors Ratana at the Pa , the first time the home side has won at home against the visitors since 2014.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">In contrast to recent seasons Pirates, stranded on the bottom of the points table, will struggle this weekend.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Similarly, Ratana, at home for a second successive week, will find Dave Hoskin Carriers Marist hard to beat with the visitors defending the Grand Hotel Challenge Shield. Last Ratana win over the greens was 24-0 at home in 2015.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Taihape and Wanganui Car Centre Kaierau could have a close game at Kaierau even although the northern club has won nine of the last 11 matches between the two clubs with the two defeats 40-24 in the premier consolation final at Spriggens Park in 2017 and 24-15 at Devon Park in 2014.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">After suffering two slender defeats &mdash; 9-10 to Waverley Harvesting Border and 5-8 to Ruapehu in away fixtures &mdash; Taihape needs a win to climb from fifth on the table. Thirdplaced Kaierau, 4 pts ahead of Taihape, was thwarted 24-20 by Border in a first loss of the season last weekend, Craig Clare landing two late penalties for victory.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Border, which has been involved in three loose encounters this year, as the points differential of plus 3 pts clearly indicates, will be hoping for a more convincing win in the annual &ldquo;Duck Shooting Opening Weekend&rdquo; clash against Settlers Honey Ngamatapouri at Dallison Park on Friday night.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Ngamat, however, can be troublesome as proven by a home win over Pirates and holding Marist to 18-15 before a lack of fitness took over.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data"><em><strong>Key senior games</strong></em></p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">The clashes between title holder Kelso Hunterville and Utiku OB at Taihape and Marist Celtic and Speirs Food Marton on Spriggens Park are two key fifth round senior matches on Saturday.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Hunterville (157 pts for and 40 against) is unbeaten as is Celtic (165 &mdash; 53) with 19 points each, one ahead of Stihl Shop Wanganui Challenge Shield holders Bennett&rsquo;s Taihape (116 -70), with Utiku (181 &mdash; 53), on 15 pts, rounding out the top four at present.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">There are five more qualifying rounds remaining to find the top four clubs to join the bottom two premier sides to contest the Div 2 championship.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Celtic tackle fifth-placed Marton (112 &mdash; 66 and 11 pts) while Taihape travels to defend the Challenge Shield against seventh positioned Kaierau (6 pts) at the Country Club.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Counties (7 pts), celebrating a 50th jubilee over Queen&rsquo;s Birthday weekend, managed a first win for the year last Saturday, 29-14 away against Kaierau, and is currently sixth. The club is hoping for a win over struggling Waverley at Dallison Park on Friday night.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Taihape faces a shield challenge from Marist Buffalos (4 pts) while Kaierau hosts winless Black Bull Liquor Pirates in two Saturday fixtures at Kaierau.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data"><em><strong>Unique woman</strong></em></p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">The death of Barbara Harding has deprived the Wanganui Rugby Football Union of a person who held a unique honour in the sport locally.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">She is the only woman in the union&rsquo;s 131-year history to have been a senior grade rep selector and to provide three sons to Wanganui inter-provincial representative teams.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">The Harding families have been tremendous supporters of Wanganui and Northern Wanganui rugby over many years with the husband and wife combination of Bill and Barbara both holding union positions just before the turn of the century. Bill was a very active chairman of the WRFU finance committee and Barbara was a co-selector of the Wanganui women&rsquo;s rep side that met with success, particularly in 1992.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">There were six senior women&rsquo;s club teams and Barbara was a co-selector, along with coach Lindsay Wheeler.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Their 1992 rep side was very competitive in the Central Region, beating Hawke&rsquo;s Bay 27-12 and Manawatu&macr; (now one of the strongest women&rsquo;s unions in the country) 55-0, losing narrowly to Taranaki 29-36 and also to Wellington.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">The Wanganui squad included future NZ reps Pauline O&rsquo;Leary and Nicki Inwood (later to become a top international referee) and NZ trialist Sheree Hansen.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Barbara travelled extensively around the Wanganui union spotting women players and also following the fortunes of her sons Lachlan (39 rep caps 1982-93), Kellick (23 games 1984-91) and Ricky (3 caps 1988) at club and later rep level.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">She also assisted with her husband&rsquo;s rural fund raising working-bee ventures, mainly around the Waiouru area where they farmed, which involved WRFU officials and players, raising thousands of dollars with part of the money helping fund a men&rsquo;s trip to Melbourne for two games against Victorian State teams in 2001.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Her three sons spoke at the funeral in glowing terms of the tremendous effort their parents, and especially their mother, put into helping them develop as rugby players.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">WRFU life member and former chairman Dave Hoskin outlined Barbara&rsquo;s contribution to rugby with patron and union life member Arch Roebuck, former presidents Eric Weir and Kevin Foster (a former Wanganui women&rsquo;s sub committee chairman) and current CEO Bridget Belsham also in attendance.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">The Northern Wanganui representation included former sub-union chairman Bruce Cranston and ex-All Black Andrew Donald.</p>
