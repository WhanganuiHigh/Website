Outside of class time there's plenty of scope for those who wish to learn an instrument, join the School Choir, form their own Rock Band, or Chamber Music group. 

A lot of students are involved in the School Production as singers and instrumentalists and they play an important role in ensuring that the show is a success.



## Choir

The Choir is open to all age groups who wish to apply for an audition.

A highlight has been the three successful trips to Sydney to compete in the Australian International Music Festival where the choir has gained silver medals. 



## Jazz Band

Membership is by invitation after auditions.



## Music Lessons

The School offers Itinerant Music lessons for Violin, Cello, Clarinet, Saxophone, Guitar, Piano, Drums, Flute, Voice and Brass Instruments.



## Chamber Music Contest

The annual Chamber Music Contest provides an opportunity for students of all levels and ages to form a group and enter the contest.

Students can also apply for a music pass to gain access to the recording studio and control room or one of the five well equipped practice rooms.
