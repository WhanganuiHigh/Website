Drama is a popular subject at all year levels at Whanganui High School. 

There is also a very busy extra curricular programme running which inspires students to perform at a National level. 

In addition to the bi-annual major school production, students have the opportunity to participate in the Sheilah Winn Shakespeare Festival, One Act Play Festival, Junior Production, Theatresports and many other Cultural events.
