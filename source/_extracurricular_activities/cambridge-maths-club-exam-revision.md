Cambridge IGCSE is the world’s most popular international curriculum for 14-16 year olds, leading to globally recognised and valued Cambridge IGCSE qualifications. The syllabus is accredited in the UK and it aims to give extension level students an alternate qualification in addition to NCEA Level 1. The course forms a basis for more advanced study, leading on to the combined NCEA and AS level course in Year 12. Students who want to be successful need not only knowledge and understanding, but also need to learn how to make the best of what they know, and how to keep on learning in today’s fast-developing world. Students are entered for the IGCSE exam, which takes place in November.
