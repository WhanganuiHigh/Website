The Exploration and Discovery Club provides opportunities for students to explore remote and unique places around the North Island. The point is to enjoy new sites, make new friends, laugh, practice your car karaoke and learn a little along the way. Students need to be travel hardened and be able to withstand long van trips on very windy roads. 

**Who can join:** All students

**When:**  Usually one trip per Term. Meetings are only held prior to our trips. Membership is open, although the Facebook page is by invite via Mr Hunter. This is where all information about upcoming trips can be found, along with the daily notices.
