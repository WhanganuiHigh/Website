Kapa haka plays a vital role in the culture of our school. Our performance group called Kia Whaiora has performed creditably in both local and regional events and hold pride of place during the School's formal occasions. Kapa haka can also be studied under Maori Performing Arts, which is now offered as a stand alone subject in Years 11 to 13.

> _Kua tu te ropu kapahaka o Kia Whaiora i roto nga whakataetae huri noa i te motu, te rohe hoki, a ka tu rangatira i roto i nga kaupapa nui o te kura._
