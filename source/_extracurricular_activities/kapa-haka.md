Kapa haka plays a vital role in the culture of our school. Our performance group called Kia Whaiora has performed creditably in both local and regional events and hold pride of place during the School's formal occasions.

The Roopu also lend all Māori Kaupapa in the school; including Waiata, Karakia and Pōwhiri.

Our students are ambassadors and role models within our community.

> _Kua tu te ropu kapahaka o Kia Whaiora i roto nga whakataetae huri noa i te motu, te rohe hoki, a ka tu rangatira i roto i nga kaupapa nui o te kura._
