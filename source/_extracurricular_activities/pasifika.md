Fanau Pasifika contributes a lively presence to the culture of our school.

Our students have the opportunity to become leaders while celebrating and expressing themselves through culture and language.

Pasifika students develop confidence through regional and local performance.



##  2018 Pasifika Fusion

Well done to our Whanganui High School Pasifika group who performed at the Regent on Broadway in Palmerston North on 4 and 5 July at Pasifika Fusion 2018.

We are very proud of our Pasifika students and the tremendous effort they put in to preparing this performance.
