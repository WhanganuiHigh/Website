**Welcome to Whanganui High School.**  

Whanganui High School is a leading co-educational secondary school. We have over 1500 students; more than 100 specialist teachers and more than 50 support and administration staff.  

The choice of secondary school for your son or daughter needs to be a carefully considered decision. I personally assure you that Whanganui High School is an outstanding school, with nationally significant points of difference across all academic, cultural and sporting areas.  

In addition to this, our school values of LIFE (Learning, Integrity, Fellowship, Excellence) underpin the balanced and caring education we offer to our students.  

Students at Whanganui High School enjoy all the advantages associated with attending a large secondary school - a diverse range of educational opportunities; access to all our dedicated and well-qualified teachers; a fully inclusive and welcoming learning environment - as well as benefitting from the personalised learning that occurs in all classes and across the entire school.  

You are always very welcome to visit our school and meet with me at any time.  

Kind Regards
