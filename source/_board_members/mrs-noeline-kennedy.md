I have held the position of Bursar at Wanganui High School since 1997. I am responsible for the financial management services of the school, including financial reporting and budgeting. In addition, a component of my role is payroll management and overall responsibility for the schoolâ€™s support staff.

Over a number of years the Board has opted not to have a Finance Sub-committee, and therefore I attend Board meeting in a support role, to present monthly financial reports.

I hold a Diploma of Business from Wanganui UCOL. I have a number of interests but enjoy first and foremost, my family, friends and holidaying.
