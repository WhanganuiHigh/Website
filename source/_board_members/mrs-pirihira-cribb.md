Tēnā kautau tātau e te kaupapa tangata e ahu mai ki tēnei kura o tātau.

Ko Pirihira (Piri) Cribb tōku ingoa.  He uri tēnei no ngā tahataha o te awa tupua o Whanganui me ngā roto tapu o Te Arawa e tuku mihi ki a kautau katoa.

I stumbled in to the board room by way of my attendance at a whānau hui when my youngest child began her journey here at Whanganui High School.  We had come from a small primary school background and this was a new experience for both of us.  I knew that if she was going to foot it in a big school like Whanganui High School I was going to have to walk that journey with her.  So far it has been well worth every step.

I’m here as the representative of the Māori whānau at Whanganui High School so I accept the responsibility to bring a Māori worldview to the board table.  I also accept the huge challenges that brings with it in terms of assisting my fellow board members, our staff, students, families and wider community to what that looks like in practise without simply creating a superficial environment that has no substance.

The LIFE values of Whanganui High School are consistent with the values and practises of Te Ao Māori so it is my goal as a mother and representative of the Māori whānau to contribute to the architecture of practising those at our school by way of my place at the board table.

Kia Whaiora (that we might have life)
