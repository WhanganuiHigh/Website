We came to Whanganui from Whangarei in 2004 intending to stay for 6 months, but are still here in 2019.  This is my home.  I am a self-employed Financial Advisor.  In this role, I have travelled extensively all over NZ, especially the North Island.  Over the years I have owned and operated various successful businesses, some which have been sold.  My work has helped me to understand the best way to move forward as a team.

I have a son in Year 10 at Whanganui High School, while my other son is in Year 7 at Whanganui Intermediate School.  My daughter left Whanganui High School at the end of 2018 to further her studies at University.  

I am passionate about education, and wish to make sure every child at our school can reach their highest possible standard in educational achievement.  I bring my own unique set of skills and experiences to the board.  It does not matter how many resources you have, if you do not use them properly it will never be enough.  I sincerely believe anything is possible with a positive mental attitude.

As a Trustee, I am working to ensure the success of our school and a bright future for our children.  We need an education system where all children are expected to succeed and one where we all take shared responsibility in ensuring this happens.  As a member of a school board I believe I can make things happen â€“ and can make a difference.
