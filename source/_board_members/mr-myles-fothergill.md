I am a local family man and business owner of Q-West Boat Builders based in Whanganui.  Having also been involved in various governance roles over the past 12 years across various business sectors, I am particularly passionate about education and supporting youth into meaningful employment through trade training.  



I have served on the Brunswick School Board of Trustees for two consecutive terms since 2013 with three of those years as Chairman.  Under my leadership we achieved our goal of providing each student with Apple devices (Years 7 and 8, MacBooks) and introduced digital learning platforms for our students.  This was entirely funded by the school/board with no contribution requirement from parents.  We also completely rebuilt the school swimming pool, including new automated filter and dosing systems, all of which was fully externally funded.  With the Principal and teaching staff, we significantly raised student achievement well above the Government’s national target.



I offer my nomination for a trustee position on Whanganui High School Board of Trustees to add value to what I believe is one of the best schools in our region.  I will bring considerable experience to the table, particularly around sound governance, leadership and career futures, particularly in trades.



I currently have a daughter in Year 11 at Whanganui High School, a granddaughter in Year 9 and another daughter due to start in 18 months’ time.



I am also currently Chairman of Whanganui District Council’s economic development agency, Whanganui and Partners (W&P), responsible for growing the district’s economy.  A large component of W&P’s role is in the education space which gives me good insight into what needs doing in the future.
