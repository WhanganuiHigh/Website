Having had three terms of experience as an elected Board of Trustees representative, and many more years of experience in Health & Safety, Human Resources and Quality Assurance, I am certain I will provide a valuable addition to the Whanganui High School Board.



I am passionate about the value of education and strongly believe in transparency and teacher/parent partnerships in achieving great outcomes for our children. I have ambition to contribute to the great learning environment at the School, which enables staff and children to succeed.



Serving on a Board is very rewarding, and even more so in the current education environment of new goals, priorities and directions.



I believe Whanganui High School has a proud tradition of excellence in not only academia, but also in sports, cultural and arts endeavours, but this is a journey and requires foresight and diligence from the whole School community to maintain such achievements.
