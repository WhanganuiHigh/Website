I have been employed as a full time teacher of English and Social Studies at WHS for the past 10 years. I am currently in charge of the Year 11 English courses. My teacher inquiry is focused on literacy for our at risk students as they enter Year 11. I have had one of my children educated at WHS, and I have coached basketball and hockey during this time.



As the Staff Trustee on the Board I want to ensure that there is open and transparent communication from the Board to the Staff, and vice versa. Over the last six years I have watched lots of positive change occur but often at the expense of the good will and morale of the Staff. I would like to work with the Board to ensure that Staff have an avenue to express their views without prejudice. I believe there is a need for Staff to have a better understanding of the Boardâ€™s processes and decisionmaking.



I am approachable, open minded and ready to assist Staff in a confidential and supportive way. I believe that in the past there has been an unnecessary distance in the relationship between the Staff and the Board. We both have the interest of the students and the wider community at the forefront of our minds. I believe if we work together using a positive framework we can achieve much more. I will be a strong advocate for you and welcome the opportunity to represent the Staff as part of this process.
