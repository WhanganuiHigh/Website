I am a full-time Teacher of English and Teacher-in-Charge of Year 11 English.  I have managed hockey and basketball teams and am continuing with the latter in 2019.

I have been the Staff Trustee for the past three years.  During this time, I was involved with the Principalâ€™s appointment in 2017.  Following the changes to the Health and Safety legislation, I was also involved in the establishment of the Health and Safety Committee and subsequent ticketing system.

During my ten years at Whanganui High School I have witnessed a change to the clientele in our classes, and the diverse range of educational and pastoral needs which are associated with them.  I believe it is important that the BOT are aware of this and the additional pressure which this puts on the school systems and staff.  I believe we need to be proactive in dealing with these changes and support the staff in working to help students gain success in this current climate.

I would also like to continue with the push for the BOT to look at and address the wellbeing of our large and hard-working staff, both inside and outside the classroom .  I believe providing a healthy and safe working environment, for both staff and students, is a priority for the board and should be the focus over the next three years.  Great learning environment = happy teachers = successful students.
