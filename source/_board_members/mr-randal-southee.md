I was elected onto the Whanganui High School Board in 2013, having previously been on the Board of Trustees for St Johnâ€™s Hill School. Currently, I have my eldest son at Whanganui High School in Year 12 and another starting next year, so I am keen to continue to contribute to the School community.



We have some exciting projects ahead over the next three years, with a successful ERO visit in late 2015, the Board is now about to embark on a wider community engagement programme this school term to develop both our vision for WHS, and importantly what the community would like to see our graduate students develop into.



I have had successful management and leadership experience across both private and not-for-profit sectors. My strengths are in governance, strategy and leadership. We are fortunate to have a great team of dedicated and passionate teachers, and a diverse and culturally rich community that afford our children the very best opportunity and environment to succeed in their educational endeavours. It is a great privilege to serve on the Board for another term and see completion of the work that has been started over the last term.
