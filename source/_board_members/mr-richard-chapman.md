My wife, Leanne and I have three children. Our two daughters completed their secondary education at Whanganui High School (WHS) and our son is currently enjoying Year 10 at WHS.



For the majority of my career I have been involved in the Motor Industry - from leaving school and completing my Trade Certificate in Automotive Electrical Engineering to now working as a National Moderator for an Industry Training Organisation. With working in the tertiary education sector for the past 12 years I understand the importance of a good education.



For the last three years I have been a member of the Whanganui High School Board of Trustees and have enjoyed the challenges and responsibilities of the role. It has been a privilege and I look forward to serving in this role for another three years.
