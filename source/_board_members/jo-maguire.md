Tēnā koutou katoa



My name is Jo Maguire and I have lived in Whanganui for most of my life. My family is of great importance to me and I enjoy spending time with them. I am married to Paul, who is a former pupil of the school, and we have two daughters.



I am a Team Leader at St John’s Hill School and have been a teacher for 20 years working in both low and high decile schools. I work with families and whanau, transitioning to school every day and I am very approachable.



I have the health and well-being of the learners as a high priority. I have a professional manner and want the best education for our learners at Whanganui High School. I work with and understand the New Zealand Curriculum, School Policies and Educational Guidelines. I will be able to ask appropriate questions for you and on your behalf. I am forward thinking and am wondering what future learning will look like and how e-learning will support our learners into the next decade.



I am very proud and privileged to be a new member of the Board of Trustees in 2016 and look forward to being a part of this fantastic school.
