I stood for re-election to the Whanganui High School Board of Trustees as a Trustee with 16 years Board of Trustees experience, serving on the Board of Aotea College, Cullinane College, Churton Primary School and Whanganui High School. I have chaired two Boards for a total of six years, and with twelve years in Local Government as a Porirua City Councillor, bring a wealth of meeting experience to the Board.



My wife, Lisa and I have three children at Whanganui High School and our youngest will start in 2017. I am self-employed and my work experience includes banking, accounting and business management. I am also a Justice of the Peace.



I have been a conscientious member of the Board over the past three years, with responsibility for a Board watching brief on Property matters and latterly Health and Safety. The upgrade and refurbishment of the Schoolâ€™s classrooms have continued over the past three years and we have also seen the long awaiting completion of the new Hard Court surfaces.



The Board of Trustees and Whanganui High School continue to face a number of challenges over the next three years and beyond, and I believe that I can continue to contribute to resolving those issues.



I look forward to being able to continue to play a part in the ongoing development of our High School for the betterment of Students, Staff and Parents.
