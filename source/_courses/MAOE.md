The Year 9 Te Reo M훮ori programme has been devised for second language learners and is an introduction to learning Te Reo M훮ori. However, if students are already proficient in Te Reo or have been in an immersion class they should inform the school and they will have the option to study NCEA Level 1. Students will cover a range of basic language activities for everyday life and some customary tikanga.
