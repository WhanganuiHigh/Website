This Level 3 course will give the student the opportunity to gain Achievement Standards and Unit Standards with a focus on communication skills. This course is not primarily based on literary texts, as are the Achievement Standards Level 3 English courses. It also does not rely as heavily on essay writing skills. Some Unit Standards will also be available to students, including the introductory career pathways exploration, US4251, used as a future focus at the beginning of the year.
