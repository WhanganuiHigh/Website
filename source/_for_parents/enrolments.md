The Board is aware that there is likely to be a high demand for places in the school. The Board is also aware that it has a responsibility to parents to support them in their wish to enrol students at the school of their choice, i.e. Whanganui High School. The Ministry of Education has advised the Board that it expects the school to have an enrolment scheme, however, the School welcomes all enrolment applications.

The school appreciates the support it receives from the community and welcomes applications from all those families who value the excellent education Whanganui High School can offer.
