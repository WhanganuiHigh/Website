My name is TRAN NGOC THUAN. I'm from Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh City. My classmates call me BRIAN.

In HCM City, the weather is very hot, about 30 or 33 degree. So I felt very cold when I came New Zealand. This is the first time I go abroad. When I came to Wanganui Air-plane, there were 3 person who picked me up :Mr Lakeland-my teacher, my host mother and my Hong Kong friend who stayed with me. I thought that may be I were bored because a different language. But when I came to Wanganui High School, I were very happy.

In my class, there were many international students, who were from Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Turkey, Costa Rica, Italy, Samoa,... They were friendly and happy. I have been WHS 1 week. I thank you my teachers very much because they always help me by the best of their ability. I think WHS is as well as my school in Vietnam, I have condition to study: computer, library,...I like to study at Wanganui High School
