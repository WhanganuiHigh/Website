On the Twenty first of January, I, Xinia arrived in New Zealand from Costa Rica. 

I was happy seeing that my dream to be in New Zealand for a year was now true. I have enjoyed New Zealand, my experience and how much I have learnt. I now have a lot of friends and I love New Zealand. 
I'm really interested to see the differences between my culture and the others around the whole world. 
I found it interesting how the other students like Ricky from Hong Kong and Imase from Tavalu talked about their culture and the differences between their countries but they still love New Zealand.

I want to thank everyone who is helping me make this year the best I have ever had in my life and of course, the most important people for my parents in Costa Rica. I will not forget this amazing year. Kia ora mis amigos, Chao!!!!
