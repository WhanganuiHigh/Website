The main purpose of Open Day, is to give 2019 Year 8 students and their caregivers, the opportunity to see the School's facilities and the programmes offered to students.



TWO SESSIONS: 

4.00pm - 6.00pm

7.00pm - 9.00pm

Commencing in the School Hall



Enrolment application forms for 2020 will be available at the Open Day.





As many of the rooms in the School are used, and a large number of students are involved, time is needed to both set up displays/activities and to tidy them away.  Therefore, the following arrangements have been made:





Thursday 13 June:



We will run Form Time and periods 1, 2 and 3 as normal, and students will be released from school at 12.50pm. 



Once dismissed, it is expected that students will go to their own homes, and not into town.



Supervision will be available for bus students and other students requiring it.

Please advise the Student Centre (Phone 349 0177) if supervision is required.





Friday 14 June:



Students will be expected at school at the usual time of 8.45am for Form Time.
