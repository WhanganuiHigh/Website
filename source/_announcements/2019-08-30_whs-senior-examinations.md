Thursday 12 September - Friday 20 September

The Senior exam timetable has been confirmed and is live on the student pages (in the Google bookmarks).

You will all get a personalised exam timetable in your SCHOOL email (access also in the Google bookmarks). 

Good Luck!

All subjects will be offering an examination and students are expected to attend these.

Study leave is a privilege not a right, and therefore students have to earn the permission to have study leave. Students will be considered, case by case, based on their effort in class and their academic performance. Students will be told whether they qualify for study leave or not by Monday 2 September. A study leave pass will be issued, and parents of those students who have not earned a study leave pass will be contacted.
