The Visual Art Department is a modern multi room facility on two sites within the campus, where a comprehensive range of programmes are taught from Year 9 to Year 13. The A block complex consists of two multipurpose art rooms, digital breakout spaces, library, and a dedicated design space. The photography suite, located in D block, houses a digital editing suite where students develop skills in Photoshop and image manipulation. Senior students have the option of working within a dedicated printmaking space where silkscreen, woodcut, and dry point printmaking are explored. On entering Year 9 students elect to have one term in Visual Art and experience a full range of art making processes from traditional practices through to digital media.
