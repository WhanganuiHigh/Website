<p><span>SOUTHBOUND: Wanganui gymnasts Crista Yum (left), WHS student&nbsp;<strong>Millie Manning</strong> (right) Amorangi Rayner (centre) and Amardin Firaza take their talents South to the National Gymsports Championship in Invercargill.</span></p>
<p>Four Wanganui Boys and Girls Gym Club athletes have been selected to join gymnasts from Palmerston North and Taihape to represent Whanganui-Manawatu at the National Gymsports in Invercargill later this month.</p>
<p>The championships run from September 28 to October 2.</p>
<p>For step 5 gymnasts Crista Yum (12) and Amorangi Rayner (12), it is their first time at the National Championships and they are looking forward to the experience.</p>
<p>Level 5 gymnast Amardin Firaza (11) competed at the 2015 nationals and achieved two top 10 apparatus placings and also made it into the all-around final.</p>
<p>Millie Manning (17) was 4th overall, second on beam and third on floor at the 2015 nationals. This year she has been selected by Gymsports NZ for the New Zealand step 10 team to compete against Australia in the Trans-Tasman Challenge that runs alongside the National Championships.</p>
<p>Club head coach Kelly Taylor-Ward said the gymnasts and their families would like to thank everyone who supported their fundraising efforts whom without they would struggle to make the trip to Invercargill.</p>
