<p>Good Afternoon,&nbsp;</p>
<p>A student from Whanganui High School, Emelye Brown, participated in the New Zealand Lions Clubs Young Speechmaker Contest on Saturday 4th August.&nbsp;</p>
<p>13 contestants from throughout NZ competed and Emelye, who spoke on Animal Welfare, was successful in taking out first place and rewarded with a 5 week holiday to the USA/Canada over the Christmas break.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Emelye represented your school, staff and her family with dignity and humility and all can be very proud of her achievement.&nbsp;</p>
