<p>Jaime Hogg and Ella Kingston competed at The Royal A &amp; P Show which was held in the Hawkes Bay 17-19 October 2018.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jaime went very well winning the Pony Equitation Showhunter class which is judged on the rider and received some 3rds and 4ths in other classes jumping up to 1m.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ella has a promising jumping pony, she is working hard getting him out and about for experience.&nbsp; He handled his first major show very well and they are looking forward to improving throughout the season.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wanganui Petre Pony Club sent a Wanganui Team to the North Island Showhunter Team Champs in Foxton 28-30 September 2018.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jaime Hogg, Ella Kingston and Aliesha Waghorn were part of the Wanganui Sharks Showhunter Team.&nbsp; The Team finished in the placings with a 6th out of 19 teams which was a fantastic achievement for a very small club. Aliesha was 3rd individually overall in her Category out of 38 riders and 3rd in the pairs with Abbey Peters from St Annes.&nbsp; Jaime was 2nd in the Equitation round in her Category. Another High School old boy Nicholas O'Leary was in the team also and placed 3rd in his Equitation and 2nd individually Overall.&nbsp; Nic is doing Young Rider and Grand Prix Showjumping this year and is now a qualified farrier. He is also a sponsored rider for Canterbury Equestrian so is doing very well in both his business and sport.&nbsp;</p>
