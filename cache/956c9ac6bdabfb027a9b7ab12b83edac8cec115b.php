<p>On 4&nbsp;November Whanganui High School took 4 teams of 4 to the Big Bang 6 hour adventure race just out of Levin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was an early start waking up at 5am and starting at 7:30am. The teams had to navigate by foot, mountain bike and tube floating down a river as part of the course.</p>
<p>It was a massive day for all students with 2 of the 4 teams finishing in a time of 7 hours 42 min in 13<sup>th</sup> and 14<sup>th</sup> place and the other 2 teams finishing in a time of 9 hours and 20 min in 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> place out of 27 teams.</p>
<p>The teams where made up of only year 9, 10 and 11 students apart from 2 year 13s so the future looks strong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well done team on a massive day.</p>
