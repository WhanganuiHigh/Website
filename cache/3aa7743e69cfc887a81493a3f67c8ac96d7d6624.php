<?php $__env->startSection('postContent'); ?><p>Whanganui High School has 12 dedicated Science laboratories for Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Electronics.</p>
<p>Each laboratory is well resourced with standard scientific apparatus and all are fitted with gas and water stations. Two knowledgeable Science technicians ensure that each teacher has access to the wide range of models, chemicals, dissections and exciting demonstrations held in the prep rooms. This ensures a varied mix of theory and practical lessons to cater for all studentsâ€™ learning needs.</p>
<p>The separate Science disciplines have their own discrete blocks and are further kitted out to the specific requirements of that subject to maximise the effectiveness of practical lessons. Chemistry laboratories are all equipped with fume cupboards to vent gases from teacher demonstrations and senior practical lessons, Physics laboratories have modified electrical supplies and girder systems for specialised experiments.</p>
<p>In keeping with the BYOT initiative of Whanganui High School, each laboratory has access to school Wi-Fi and is equipped with permanent audio visual equipment to fully integrate the use of technology into the classroom. Coupled with an excellent teaching staff, students will experience an interactive and highly immersive Science experience throughout their school career.</p><?php $__env->stopSection(); ?>
