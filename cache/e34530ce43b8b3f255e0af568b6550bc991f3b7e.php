<?php $__env->startSection('postContent'); ?><p>Whanganui High School has three gymnasiums plus a weights/fitness area. The biggest gym is the Seddon Gymnasium, which was built in approximately 10 years ago. It has a full size netball and basketball court in it. The Reeves Gymnasium has a full-size basketball and volleyball court, whilst our smaller Gymnasium – the Vogel has a half court.</p>
<p>Upstairs in the Reeves Gymnasium we have a weights and fitness area. Students are able to use equipment such as a spin bike, rowing machines, cross trainers, treadmills, free and fixed weights. An instructor is available before and after school to help students with fitness and strengthening programmes.</p>
<p>In 2015 we opened our newest sporting facility – an all purpose weather turf. There are five netball courts, a half hockey field and seven tennis courts. This turf is used by our Physical Education classes as well as our sporting teams.</p>
<p>We also have a large grass area which allows us to have two Rugby and two Football fields for our winter sports teams. We also have two artificial cricket turfs and cricket batting nets.</p>
<p>During the summer the fields are marked for Touch and Athletics. There is also a new long jump pit.</p><?php $__env->stopSection(); ?>
