<p>Guitars-a-fire and Ben Power were on fire, performing at the Wanganui Male Choirs 120th Jubilee Concert last Sunday, 9 December.</p>
<p>"The skill and ability these students showed belied their youthful ages" - choir members and the audience commented as to their excellent performance.</p>
<p>Their presentation was immaculate and not only bought credit to themselves but to Whanganui High School.</p>
