<p class="element element-paragraph"><br />In an in-house Castlecliff Club Mustangs battle two teams went to war for bragging rights and the Wanganui Softball Association Reserve Cup on Saturday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mustangs Black, fresh from their Manawatu competition victory the previous weekend, succumbed to the older, more experienced players in the Mustangs 5-3.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Both teams were scoreless in their first turn at bat. The black team were retired without scoring in their second turn at bat, but then Castlecliff Mustangs put bat to ball.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Trent Hemi</strong> hit safely, followed by hits from Danny Green and Matt Ranga, and with a couple of wayward throws and a perfect bunt by Lenox Folds, three runs were scored.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Black team were next to score when Marama Savage picked up a walk, stole two bases and scored on a hit by Johnny Kiwara.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Castlecliff Mustangs added two more runs during their next bat, when <strong>Ben Hollis</strong> hit to the outfield for a two base hit. <strong>Hemi</strong> then hit deep to centrefield where a diving catch was spilled by the fielder and both runners scored to give Mustangs a 5-1 lead.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In the 7th innings the Black team came out firing. Youngsters <strong>Kevin Rennie</strong> <strong>and Devon Maihi</strong> both hit safely with one and two base hits with Rennie scoring off the Maihi hit. Maihi was scored by sacrifice hit from Savage.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Pitching for Black <strong>Maihi</strong> faced 26 batters taking out 9 at the plate, while giving up 8 hits. Green for Mustangs faced 28 batters took 11 strikeouts and conceded 5 hits.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Congratulations must go to The Castlecliff Club Mustangs Black team , Who took out their section of the Manawatu competition last weekend with a solid 7-0 win over Bromac Bombers.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"This was an amazing effort from this young side who are performing very well under the coaching of Shaun Pirere," head club coach Ron Hollis said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">'Shaun's done a fantastic job with these boys. With a lot of players coming from a slowpitch competition last season to having both teams now in the top section of the Manawatu reserve grade next season is a real achievement for our boys.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Mustangs will be entering a women's team next season so anyone wanting to play are most welcome. Thank you to all our supporters who travelled every week to cheer us on," Hollis said.</p>
