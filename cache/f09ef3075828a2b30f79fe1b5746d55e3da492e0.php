<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">High school grateful to its volunteers.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">The Sport Whanganui review of college sport continues with the spotlight firmly on Whanganui High School this week.</span></p>
<p>Whanganui High School relies heavily on a large base of volunteers to&nbsp;<span>coach and manage an equally large variety of sporting codes available to students.</span>.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Sport co-ordinator Lisa Murphy said that, without volunteers, the school would be unable to cover the wide range of sports played by the student body.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">"We heavily rely on our community, which includes staff members and students. Without these people we would not be able to field teams each week to play in the local competitions", Murphy said.</span></p>
<p><strong>"WHS would like to say a huge THANK YOU to all our coaches and managers who every week give up their time to coach our teams.</strong> <strong>Not only do they take time to plan the sessions, they turn up in all weather conditions for trainings and stand on the side lines of the fields, courts and turfs to support our students".</strong></p>
<p>This year with the support from Sport Whanganui and Kiwisport, WHS have been able to provide a programme to develop coaches, who then pass on their knowledge and skills to develop their players and grow participation in the school sports.</p>
<p>"Our local sports codes provide coach development to our coaches also. This is a major part of our Sports Performance Programme at WHS over the next two years".</p>
<p>"Engaging in sports enhances the development of students&rsquo; learning and social skills, providing the opportunity at WHS for them to become all round students", Murphy said.&nbsp;</p>
