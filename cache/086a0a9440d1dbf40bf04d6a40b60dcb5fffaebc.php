<?php $__env->startSection('postContent'); ?><p>The purpose of ERO's reviews is to give parents and the wider school community assurance about the quality of education that schools provide and their children receive. ERO's reports are intended to be clear, concise, constructive and evaluative. An ERO school report answers the question &quot;How effectively is this school's curriculum promoting student learning - engagement, progress and achievement?&quot; Under that overarching question ERO reports on the quality of education and learning outcomes for children and for specific groups of children including Maori students, Pacific students and students with special needs. ERO also reports on the quality of the school's systems for sustaining and continuing improvements.</p>
