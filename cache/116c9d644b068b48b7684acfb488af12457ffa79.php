<p><span>CRNZ High Performance Athlete Pathway Programmes:</span></p>
<p><span>Based on the characteristics, needs, and considerations specific to each stage of development, CRNZ has designed corresponding Athlete Pathway Programmes.</span><br /><br /><span>From Foundation to High Performance, the standards, provisions, commitment and expectations of the CRNZ Athlete Pathway Programmes progressively increase. As your performance improves, so too does your level of involvement, the opportunities available, and level of support provided.</span><br /><br /><span>Each year following the Canoe Sprint National Championships, athletes will be assessed and invited to join the appropriate Pathway Programme. Ongoing involvement in Pathway Programmes and transition opportunities will be assessed via regular performance planning and monitoring processes.</span></p>
