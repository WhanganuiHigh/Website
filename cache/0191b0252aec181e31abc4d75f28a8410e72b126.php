<p>There were plenty of thrills and not many spills at the Vintage Weekend Soapbox Derby in Drews Avenue, Whanganui, yesterday.</p>
<p>Organiser Jamie Williamson said 17 carts and 18 drift bikes were entered in the races, with competitors' ages ranging from 6 to nearly 60.</p>
<p>Experienced competitors Scott Emerson and Shea Robinson, both 14 and WHS students, were trying out their "upcycled" 1980s BMX with sidecar for the first time.</p>
