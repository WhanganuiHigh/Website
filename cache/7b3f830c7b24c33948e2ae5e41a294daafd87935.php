<p><strong>Whanganui High School student Abigail Watt played a very integral role on ANZAC day at four different services around Whanganui, Brunswick and Marton. </strong></p>
<p>This picture is of Abigail guarding the Cenotaph in Whanganui. She held this position for more then 30 minutes on four separate occasions on ANZAC day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Abigail has been part of the New Zealand Defense Force (NZDF) Army Cadet programme, for the last 3 years; and has been gaining ranking stripes for the last 18 months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year she went from Cadet Watt to Lance Corporal Watt and over the holidays she attended a National NZDF force leadership course for a week at Ohakea. She was one of only four from Whanganui to be selected to attend. Abigail successfully passed this course (which was incredibly difficult) and as a result was recommended for further promotion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Tuesday night she received her 3rd Stripe and is now Corporal Watt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her next goal is the Sargent Stripe.</p>
