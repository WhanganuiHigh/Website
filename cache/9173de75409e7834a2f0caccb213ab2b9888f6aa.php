<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>One hundred teams battled it out at Jubilee Stadium, putting their brains to the test in Whanganui High School's first house quiz.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">About 500 students from Awa, Maunga, Moana and Whenua houses combined to take on each other, answering 10 questions from 10 categories with prizes on the line.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The grand prize was a trophy designed by head of technology Craig Adam which incorporates the house names and the meanings behind them.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui High School prefects Raoul Sarup and Rhea Colaabavala helped to organise last Friday's event.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The house system's new this year, this was a way that we could incorporate an academic event and get people involved in something that isn't sports," Sarup said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It also gets people to work together who potentially wouldn't have worked together otherwise."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Sarup came up with the idea of having a trophy made for the winning team and their house.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We're hoping that over the years we can add plaques to it and hopefully when we're gone it will carry on for years to come.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"This was a challenge that I wanted to take on. It has been a real group effort and it's a testament to the culture of the school and how well the house system has worked."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Principal Martin McAllen started his tenure at the school last year and was surprised the school did not have a house system in place.</p>
