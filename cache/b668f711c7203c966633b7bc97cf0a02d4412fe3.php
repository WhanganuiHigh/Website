<p>Fifty one students from Wanganui High School will be part of the Australian International Music Festival held at the Sydney Opera House from Saturday 27 June to Saturday 4 July 2015.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wanganui High School is a large public school of approximately 1800 students in the Central North Island of New Zealand.&nbsp; With a passionate and talented performing arts faculty, the school has excelled over the years at major musical productions, one-act festivals, and stage challenge competitions, placing first nationally in the latter event 7 out of the last 10 years.&nbsp; In 2008, Wanganui High School nurtured our first international choral group, performing eloquently on the stage at the Sydney Opera House, bringing to the stage the story of the New Zealand and Australian ANZACs.&nbsp; We followed this with an encore appearance in 2012, focusing on the love songs of Broadway, and bringing a Glee-style show to the admiring eyes and ears of Australians.&nbsp; This year, we will be treating audiences to a toe-tapping, hummable History of Music in Twenty Minutes, with our unique blend of song and dance.</p>
