<p><span>WHS had two teams competing at the annual Massey Manawatu Maths and Statistics&nbsp;(M3S)&nbsp;Competition held in Palmerston North on Thursday 30 June.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Our WHS3 team of&nbsp;</strong><span><strong>Jackie Hazelhurst, Alistair Hughes and Vincent Collins</strong>&nbsp;</span><strong>were a close second.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Eighteen teams from nine schools answered 35 questions at the National Certificate of Educational Achievement level one mathematics and statistics.</span></p>
<p><span>The year 12 students from around the Manawatu region participated in teams of three to work their way through the questions. Teams had to work without calculators and the final question was designed to be the most difficult, requiring both speed and accuracy in the answer. Points were given for the correct answer and strategic approach in solving.</span></p>
