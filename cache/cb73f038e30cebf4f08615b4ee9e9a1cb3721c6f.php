<p>Kia Whaiora – ‘That we may have life’ is the name of our School Whare.</p>
<p>The Whare was opened in 1999. </p>
<p>The stunning kowhaiwhai panels were painted by Matua Reg and students in 1998.</p>
<p>In 2008 the beautiful tukutuku panels were made. We were lucky to have the expertise of two local kuia, Nannies Rii Templeton and the late Vicky Puru. They were assisted by Whānau, Staff in the Māori Dept and Student’s in Te Reo Māori and Māori Performing Arts classes.</p>
<p>Our Whare has been very busy, there have been classes from Te Reo Māori, Drama and Life Skills, with Kia Whaiora and Pasifika using it for practices &amp; noho.</p><?php $__env->stopSection(); ?>
