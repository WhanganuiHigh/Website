<p><img src="/uploads/51636d12896ad857e2001121/Picture-038-test3.jpg" alt="" />Te Atawhai is the name given to the Special Unit at Whanganui High School.  Te Atawhai was designed specifically for students with moderate to severe intellectual impairments.  The building, furniture and equipment were funded by the Ministry of Education.  It opened in May 1996.</p>
<p>Te Atawhai provides a secondary school placement for students with an intellectual impairment who require alternative or additional resources to those usually provided in regular education settings.  The guiding philosophy of Te Atawhai is to enable all students to develop their full potential by providing age appropriate, individualised learning opportunities within a safe, caring, challenging and supportive environment.</p>
<p>This is achieved through adapted programmes or learning environments, specialised equipment or materials.  The provision of a multi-sensory curriculum is combined with a physical therapy programme to meet the needs of all students.  Te Atawhai endeavours to ensure the highest standards of achievement through its individualised and developmental programmes.</p>
<p>Te Atawhai is a partnership based on collaboration and consultation between Parents and Caregivers, Students, Ministry and Special Education, Specialists, Local and School Community, and other agencies to meet the needs of all students with special needs.</p>
<p>Social integration and subject mainstreaming are encouraged at Whanganui High School. </p>
