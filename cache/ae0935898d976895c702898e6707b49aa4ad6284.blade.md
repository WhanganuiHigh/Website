<p>Age Group Track National Championship was held at the&nbsp;Avantidrome in Cambridge from 7-10 March&nbsp;2019.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This is New Zealand's premier national track cycling event for Age Group riders from U15's through to Masters riders. &nbsp;Riders are selected to represent their Cycling Centres ensuring the top riders attend to race for national titles.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Track cycling events involve a mix of speed, skill and tactics. The sport is highly competitive and hugely entertaining, and because events are raced in a velodrome, track is arguably the best type of cycling for spectators.</span></span></p>
