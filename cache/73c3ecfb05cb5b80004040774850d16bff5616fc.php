<h2>Whanganui High School Motto</h2>
<p>'That we might have life'</p>
<p>Our school motto is from the New Testament, from the Book of John, Chapter 10, Verse 10 <em>'I am come that they might have life, and they might have it more abundantly&quot;.</em></p>
<p>The interpretation of our motto is that through academic, cultural, sporting and socialisation opportunities the school provides, the individual will have the opportunity to live life to the full.</p>
<h2>Whanganui High School History</h2>
<p>In February 1958 a group of 148 Third Formers gathered for the first Assembly in the present D1. There was a staff of nine.</p>

<p>By 1969 the roll had risen to 1100. The first Principal, Mr A.T. Gibson, emphasised 'manners, character, scholarship and human relations'.  He stressed that the School was not an 'it' - the 'family' life of the school was vital. These emphases have remained.</p>
<p>The school developed a tradition of 'self-help' and through much fundraising has built up some very good facilities for the use of the students and staff. Facilities such as; the Swimming Pool (1962), the Gymnasium (1968), the Centre Court, the extensions to the Cafeteria and Theatrette (1980's), the Shelters (1990's), The Department/Ministry of Education has added the Library (1970), The Music Block (1972), Te Atawhai (1996), Music and Drama renovations (1999), Te Arahi (1999), Science Block and Dean's House (2002), and new Gymnasium facilities (2006).</p>
