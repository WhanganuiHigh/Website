<?php $__env->startSection('postContent'); ?><p>We have a secure bike storage facility located behind our G Block.</p>
<p>Students are to leave their bicycles in the bike cage. The bike cage is locked at <strong>9am</strong> and re-opened at <strong>3pm</strong>. Students that cycle to school must place their bikes <strong>within</strong> the cage and are encouraged to use a high-quality lock to secure their bike in place.</p>
<p>For extra security, we have a security camera fixed upon the bike cage area.</p>
<p>For safety, the students are asked not to ride their bikes within the school grounds, they need to walk with their bikes.</p>
<p>If access to the bike cage is needed during the school day, students can go to the Student Centre for this to be organised.</p>
<p><strong>The bike cage is locked permanently at 4.45pm</strong>, any bikes left in there will remain there overnight, please collect your bike before this time.</p><?php $__env->stopSection(); ?>
