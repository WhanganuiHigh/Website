<p>What an AWESOME week taking an AMAZING group of girls away to Waka Ama secondary school champs in Rotorua. It was my first time ever being exposed or around the sport and what a cool experience it was! I feel inspired to get my own kids paddling on our Awa back home and jumping on the Waka Ama bandwagon.&nbsp;<br /> A great week of learning from the best our Rangatahi.</p>
