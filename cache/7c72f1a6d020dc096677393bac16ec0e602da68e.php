<p>There are 240 metal lockers in C-block and some wooden lockers in F block available for student use. </p>
<p> <em>All lockers are allocated by our Student Centre.</em></p>
<p><strong>Metal Lockers</strong> <strong>(C Block)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Metal locker keys are available for $20. This is a key rental/bond refunded when you return the key at the end of the year.  Many lockers have 2 keys available so you should share with a friend. </li>
<li>If students wish to be allocated a metal locker, they <strong>MUST</strong> acquire a <strong>LOCKER REQUEST ENVELOPE</strong>  from the Student Centre. You must return payment in the pre-printed envelope.</li>
<li>The Student Centre will issue keys &amp; locker numbers by the end of February.</li>
<li>NO ENVELOPE, NO LOCKER, NO EXCEPTIONS!  It is best if you share a locker.</li>
<li>The metal lockers are secured with a master key system which means that if student lose or forget their key, a staff member can unlock it for them with a master key.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Wooden Lockers (F Block)</strong></p>
<p>Wooden lockers are free to use, you need to supply your own padlock AND fill in a form for the Student Centre, with the number of the locker you have choosen.</p>
<p><strong>Conditions of Use:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The lockers are also subject to reasonable terms of use and, being the property of the school, may be accessed by staff if there is reasonable cause to do so.</li>
<li>Lockers are for the use of students, during the school year, to temporarily store items required for school. This would include things like books, sports gear and lunch items. They must not be used to store anything that students are not permitted to have at school. For example, anything flammable, alcohol, drugs or anything that might be considered a weapon. Storage of anything valuable is discouraged as such items can be left in a secure area in the Student Centre.</li>
<li>Lockers are used on an “at your own risk” basis and the school cannot accept any responsibility for items which are damaged or go missing from a locker.</li>
<li>It is also expected that every locker key is returned, for a refund of the key bond, at the end of each school year, regardless of whether or not the student wishes to use a locker the following year.</li>
<li>Lockers must be used within the terms and conditions specified by the school. A full list of terms and conditions is available from the teacher in charge upon request.</li>
