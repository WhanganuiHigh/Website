<h4>WHANGANUI HIGH SCHOOL<br />OPEN DAY</h4>
<h4>Thursday 13 June 2019</h4>
<p>The main purpose of Open Day, is to give 2019 Year 8 students and their caregivers, the opportunity to see the School's facilities and the programmes offered to students.</p>
<h3><strong>TWO SESSIONS:</strong><br /><strong>Starting in the School Hall</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>4.00pm - 6.00pm<br /></strong><strong>7.00pm - 9.00pm</strong></h3>
<p><strong><br /><strong>Enrolment application forms for 2020 will be available at the Open Day.</strong></strong></p>
<p><br />As many of the rooms in the School are used, and a large number of students are involved, time is needed to both set up displays/activities and to tidy them away.&nbsp; Therefore, the following arrangements have been made:<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Thursday 13 June</span></strong><strong>:</strong></p>
<p><strong>We will run Form Time and periods 1, 2 and 3 as normal, and students will be released from school at 12.50pm.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Once dismissed, it is expected that students will go to their&nbsp;<strong>own homes</strong>, and not into town.</p>
<p><strong>Supervision will be available for bus students and other students requiring it.<br /></strong>Please advise the Student Centre (Phone 349 0177) if supervision is required.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Friday 14 June</span></strong><strong>:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Students will be expected at school at the usual time of 8.45am for Form Time.</strong></p>
