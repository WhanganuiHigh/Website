<p><strong>The Judge also gave a special mention to Jack Burrows (Year 13) for his 'Moutoa Soldier' photo AND to 2018's Female Art Duxium, Lily Claypole, for her photo 'Plastic'.</strong></p>

<p>The following images are not the best representations of the works..<br /><strong>Support our Visual Arts community by paying the exhibition a visit at the Sarjeant Art Gallery on Taupo Quay - until Sunday 12&nbsp; May 2019.</strong></p>
